The price is determined by the forces of supply and demand rather than decided by the seller.

Companies in this environment often use aggressive advertising to attempt to influence the price of their products. Examples include Coke and Pepsi, which offer different products but compete in the same market.</p> </li> <li> <p>Oligopoly: This is characterized by few sellers, with each seller supplying a significant margin of all the products sold. The number of entrants in this market is minimal because of the high initial investment cost. Examples include airlines such as United Airlines and Continental.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monopoly: This is characterized by one company producing a unique product or service with no close substitutes.
