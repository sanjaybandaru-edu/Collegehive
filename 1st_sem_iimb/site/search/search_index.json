It demands access to various resources that provide the necessary support, knowledge, and tools. Mainly Financial Resources, the lifeblood of business. Entrepreneurship involves pursuing opportunities despite limited resources. Resources can include equity, bootstrapping techniques, debt, and venture capital etc.  Following are the Entrepreneurial Resources: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Bootstrapping: Defined as using existing resources to grow a business. Such as using personal savings, revenue from initial sales, and other internal resources to fund the early stages of the business. Growing using the resources one has. It is a technique that you use to bring the slack resources, customers, money into your venture to play your game. Example of a young girl selling traditional food products to fund her education, she expanded her offerings based on customer demand, showcasing resourcefulness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Debt as a resource: Entrepreneurs can seek loans from family or banks to fund ventures. Loans provided by banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions specifically designed for small businesses. These loans often require collateral and a solid business plan. Example of a successful venture that started with a loan from parents.</p> </li> <li> <p>Government Grants: Various grants and subsidies are available for startups. Non-repayable funds provided by government agencies, foundations, and other organizations to support specific projects or initiatives. Grants are often competitive and require meeting specific criteria. Entrepreneurs should explore government programs like Karnataka's Elevate 100 for funding opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Corporate Social Responsibility: It is the center for social entrepreneurship and plays a vital role on how an enterprise conducts itself. It improves public image of the enterprise. </p> </li> <li> <p>Venture Capital (VC): Investment firms that pool money from various sources (e.g., pension funds, endowments) to invest in high-growth potential startups. VC funding typically comes in later stages and involves larger sums of money. Expectations for high returns necessitate rapid scaling of the business. Venture Capitalists are very careful in choosing the kind of ventures they would like to put in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Equity Financing : One of the resources you can cleverly use, is the Equity of the venture. This strategy enhances credibility, making it easier to attract investors.</p> <p>Example: Licious</p> <p>Founders aimed to disrupt the meat industry but lacked industry experience. They offered equity (one-third) to a   renowned chef to attract talent.</p> <p>Case Study: Mango Technology and Qualcomm</p> <p>Sunil and Lake initiated a venture without funds but leveraged connections to secure resources. Ram provided office space and engineers in exchange for a small equity stake (2%). The venture gained credibility by being associated with IIMB, attracting talented engineers.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"EE/Module-4_Starting_Your_Venture/4.2.1_Deliberate_Entrepreneurship.html","title":"Deliberate Opportunity-Based Entrepreneurship","text":"<p>Deliberate opportunity-based entrepreneurship describes the process where individuals or teams intentionally seek out, evaluate, and exploit identified market opportunities to create new ventures.

Money Measurement Concept:","text":"<p>The Money Measurement Concept (also known as the Monetary Unit Assumption) is a cornerstone of accounting. It dictates that only transactions and events that can be reliably expressed in monetary terms are recorded in the accounting books. This means that non-monetary aspects, even if crucial to a business's success, are not directly reflected in the financial statements.</p> <p>Why Accountants Prefer This Approach:</p> <ul> <li>Objectivity: Focusing on monetary transactions ensures objectivity and reduces subjectivity in financial reporting.</li> <li>Verifiability: Monetary transactions are easily verifiable with invoices, receipts, and bank statements.</li> <li>Consistency: Using a common monetary unit allows for consistent recording and comparison of financial data across different periods and businesses.</li> </ul> <p>Limitation:</p> <p>The limitation of the money measurement concept is that it doesn't capture the full picture of a business's value. Intangible assets like brand reputation, employee morale, and intellectual property are not directly reflected in the financial statements until they translate into measurable monetary outcomes. This is why supplemental disclosures and qualitative information are often included in company reports to provide a more holistic view.</p>"},{"location":"FSBP/Module_3_Accounting_Concepts/3.2_Entity_Concept.html","title":"2. Entity Concept","text":"<p>The Entity Concept states that a business is a separate and distinct entity from its owners. This means that the financial transactions of the business should be kept completely separate from the personal transactions of its owners. This separation applies regardless of the legal structure of the business (sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation).</p> <p>Key Implications and Explanations:</p> <ul> <li>Separate Accounting Records: Each business maintains its own set of accounting records, independent of the owner's personal finances.</li> <li>Transactions Treated at Arm's Length: Even if a transaction occurs between the owner and the business, it is treated as if it were between two unrelated parties. This ensures objectivity and prevents personal biases from affecting the business's financial records.</li> <li>Clearer Financial Picture: Separating business and personal finances provides a clearer and more accurate picture of the business's financial performance and position. This is crucial for decision-making, performance evaluation, and tax purposes.</li> </ul> <p>Examples:</p> <p>Owner Withdraws Cash:</p> <ul> <li>Scenario: In a sole proprietorship, the owner takes \u20b910,000 from the business cash register for personal expenses.</li> <li>Accounting Treatment: The accountant does not simply ignore this transaction. Instead, it's recorded as a \"withdrawal\" or \"drawings\" by the owner, or potentially as a loan to the owner, creating a receivable. This reflects the fact that the business's assets have decreased, and the owner has a liability to the business (if treated as a loan).</li> </ul> <p>Benefits of the Entity Concept:</p> <ul> <li>Accurate Performance Measurement: By separating business and personal transactions, the true profitability and financial health of the business can be accurately assessed.</li> <li>Better Decision-Making: Clear financial information enables better informed business decisions.</li> <li>Tax Compliance: Proper separation is essential for accurate tax reporting and avoids potential tax issues.</li> <li>Legal and Regulatory Compliance: In the case of corporations, the entity concept is legally mandated, providing liability protection to the owners.</li> </ul> <p>Challenges:</p> <p>Applying the entity concept can sometimes be challenging when personal and business activities are intertwined. In such cases, careful allocation and documentation are crucial.</p>"},{"location":"FSBP/Module_3_Accounting_Concepts/3.3_Going_Concern_Concept.html","title":"3.Going Concern Concept","text":"<p>The Going Concern Concept assumes that a business will continue to operate indefinitely in the foreseeable future. In other words, it assumes that the business will not be forced to liquidate its assets or cease operations in the near term. This assumption is fundamental to many accounting practices.</p> <p>Key Implications and Explanations:</p> <ul> <li>Valuation of Assets: The going concern concept justifies valuing assets at their historical cost (what the business originally paid for them) rather than their liquidation value (what they could be sold for in a forced sale). This is because the business is assumed to be using the assets for their intended purpose over their useful life, not selling them off quickly.</li> <li>Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation (for tangible assets) and amortization (for intangible assets) are based on the assumption that the asset will be used over multiple accounting periods. The cost of the asset is systematically allocated over its useful life, reflecting its gradual consumption in generating revenue.</li> <li>Classification of Assets and Liabilities: Assets and liabilities are classified as current (expected to be realized or settled within one year) or non-current (expected to be realized or settled beyond one year) based on the assumption of continued operations.</li> <li>Deferral of Expenses: Certain expenses, like prepaid insurance, are deferred and recognized over the periods they benefit, assuming the business will continue to operate and receive those benefits.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>Machine Depreciation:</p> <ul> <li>Scenario: A company purchases a machine for \u20b910 lakh with an estimated useful life of 10 years.</li> <li>Accounting Treatment: Under the going concern assumption, the company depreciates the machine over its 10-year life, charging \u20b91 lakh as depreciation expense each year. This reflects the gradual consumption of the machine's value in generating revenue. If the company were not a going concern, the machine might be valued at its immediate resale value, which could be significantly lower.</li> </ul> <p>Exceptions to the Going Concern Assumption: </p> <p>While the going concern concept is generally applied, there are situations where it is not appropriate:  * Impending Liquidation:  If a company is facing bankruptcy or has decided to liquidate its assets, the going concern assumption is no longer valid. Importance of the Going Concern Concept:  The going concern concept is crucial for:  * Meaningful Financial Reporting:  It provides a basis for consistent and relevant financial reporting.  * Investment Decisions:  Investors rely on the going concern assumption when making investment decisions.  * Credit Decisions:  Lenders also rely on this assumption when evaluating a company's creditworthiness. </p>"},{"location":"FSBP/Module_3_Accounting_Concepts/3.4_Cost_Concept.html","title":"4.Cost Concept","text":"<p>The Cost Concept, also known as the Historical Cost Principle, is a fundamental accounting principle that dictates how assets are initially recorded and subsequently reported in financial statements. The Cost Concept states that assets should be recorded at their original cost at the time of acquisition. This cost includes all expenditures necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use. Once recorded, the asset generally remains at this historical cost on the balance sheet, adjusted for depreciation or amortization (where applicable), regardless of subsequent fluctuations in market value.</p> <p>Key Implications and Explanations:</p> <ul> <li>Initial Recognition: Assets are first recorded at their historical cost, which is objective and verifiable through documentation such as invoices and purchase agreements.</li> <li>Subsequent Measurement: Generally, the asset remains at its historical cost, less accumulated depreciation/amortization. Market fluctuations or increases in value are not typically reflected in the financial statements.</li> <li>Depreciation and Amortization: For assets with a finite useful life (like machinery or patents), the cost is systematically allocated over that life through depreciation (for tangible assets) or amortization (for intangible assets). This reflects the consumption of the asset's value over time.</li> </ul> <p>Example: Machine Purchase:</p> <ul> <li>Scenario: A company buys a machine for \u20b920 lakh with a useful life of 10 years.<ul> <li>Accounting Treatment: The machine is recorded on the balance sheet at \u20b920 lakh.

This equation is:</p> <p>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</p> <p>This means that for every transaction, there will be at least two accounts affected, with one account being debited and another being credited.

This is crucial to understand because the balance sheet's values are only accurate for that exact moment. The heading of a balance sheet typically reads something like \"Balance Sheet as of 31st March 2020.\" This signifies that the data presented reflects the company's financial position on that specific date. The financial situation would likely be different even a day later, on 1st April 2020, due to ongoing business transactions.</p> <p>Accounting Periods and Reporting Delays:</p> <ul> <li>In India, the standard accounting period for companies is generally from April to March. Therefore, balance sheets are usually prepared as of 31st March of each year.</li> <li>There's often a significant time lag between the balance sheet date and the date the statement is actually published. This is because compiling and auditing the financial data takes time. For example, if a balance sheet is dated 31st March 2024, it might not be available until August 10th, 2024.</li> </ul> <p>This delay raises concerns about the relevance of the information for users of financial statements. If a balance sheet as of 31st March is only available in August, the financial position of the company might have changed considerably in the intervening months. This can make the information less useful for making timely decisions.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>Imagine a company had a large sale in April. This sale would significantly impact its cash balance, accounts receivable, and potentially inventory. If the balance sheet as of 31st March doesn't reflect this sale, it provides an incomplete and potentially outdated picture of the company's financial health.</p> <p>Quarterly Reporting to Address the Issue:</p> <p>To mitigate the problem of delayed annual financial statements, listed companies are required to publish quarterly financial statements. These provide more frequent updates on a company's financial performance and position, making the information more timely and relevant for investors and other stakeholders.</p>"},{"location":"FSBP/Module_7_Reading_Financial_Statements/7.1_Understanding_Balance_Sheet.html#sources-of-capital-for-a-business","title":"Sources of Capital for a Business","text":"<p>Capital is essential for starting and running a business.

These differences often stem from different depreciation methods used for financial reporting and tax purposes.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Depreciation Methods and Deferred Tax:</p> <ul> <li>Straight-line Depreciation: Depreciation expense is constant each year.</li> <li>Written-down Value (WDV) Depreciation: Depreciation expense is higher in the initial years and decreases over time.</li> <li>Companies might use straight-line depreciation for financial statements and WDV for tax purposes. This difference creates a deferred tax liability.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Key Points about Deferred Tax:         *   It's not a loss of revenue for the government but a deferral of payment.         *   Governments allow this to incentivize investment in new assets, which stimulates economic growth (job creation, GST payments, etc.).         *   Tax authorities may disallow certain provisions charged as expenses, leading to advance tax payments (creating a deferred tax asset). Companies often report a net value of deferred tax liabilities and assets.         *   No interest is charged on deferred tax, making it effectively an interest-free loan from the government.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>For financial statement analysis, understanding the detailed accounting entries for deferred tax is not always necessary. The key takeaway is that it represents a future tax liability.</p>"},{"location":"FSBP/Module_7_Reading_Financial_Statements/7.3_Liabilities.html#example-asian-paints","title":"Example: Asian Paints","text":"<p>As of March 2020, Asian Paints had a deferred tax liability of \u20b9282.68 crore.
