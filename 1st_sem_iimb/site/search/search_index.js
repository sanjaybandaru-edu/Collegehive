Even without deep knowledge of theory, it\u2019s evident that marketing involves the various activities happening in the market. Here, we\u2019ll start with a quote from Peter Drucker, one of the prominent management gurus, to understand marketing\u2019s purpose.</p> <p></p> <p>\"Marketing is the only distinguishing and unique function of business. If you want to know what a business is, we have to start with its purpose, and its purpose must lie outside the business itself. In fact, it must lie in the society since a business enterprise is an organ of the society. There is only one valid definition of business purpose \u2014 that is to create a customer.\"</p>"},{"location":"MF/Module_01_Basics_of_Marketing/1.c_Introduction_to_Marketing.html#key-points-from-druckers-perspective","title":"Key Points from Drucker\u2019s Perspective","text":"<ul> <li>Purpose of Business: The business\u2019s purpose is to create a customer, as the customer will provide the revenue necessary for the business to thrive.</li> <li>Market Relationship: The purpose lies outside the business, in society, with the customer.</li> <li>Customer Satisfaction: Maintaining customers requires meeting their expectations, keeping them satisfied with the offerings.</li> </ul> <p>Marketing, according to Drucker, revolves around creating and sustaining customers.

For Pepsi consumers, drinking Pepsi signifies individuality and independence, resonating with a younger audience that seeks a fresh and modern experience.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The insights from these functional, experiential, and social aspects show how Coca-Cola and Pepsi have tailored their branding strategies to offer distinct value propositions. Coca-Cola appeals to those who appreciate nostalgia and connection, while Pepsi resonates with a generation that embraces change, identity, and independence.
