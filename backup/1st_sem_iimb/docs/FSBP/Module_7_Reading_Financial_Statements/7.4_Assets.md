# Non-Current Assets

## What are Non-Current Assets?

Non-current assets are long-term investments that a company does not expect to convert to cash or consume within one year. They are held for continued use in business operations.

## Key Components of Non-Current Assets

1.  **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** These are tangible assets used in operations.

    *   **Components:** Land, buildings, plant and machinery, equipment (including research equipment), furniture and fixtures, vehicles, office equipment, and computer hardware.
    
    *   **Intangible Assets:** These are non-physical assets that provide future economic benefits. Examples include trademarks, software, goodwill, and brand value. They are treated similarly to tangible assets, with accumulated amortization instead of depreciation.
      

2.  **Right-of-Use Assets:** These represent a lessee's right to use an asset under a lease agreement.

3.  **Capital Work in Progress (CWIP):** This represents the cost of assets under construction. Once the construction is complete, the asset is transferred to PP&E. It's important to exclude CWIP when analyzing business performance, as these assets are not yet generating revenue.

4.  **Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (excluding those already mentioned):** This includes any remaining intangible assets not specifically categorized.

5.  **Investments in Subsidiaries and Associated Companies:** These are long-term investments in other companies.

6.  **Financial Assets (Non-Current):** These are long-term investments in financial instruments such as mutual funds, equity, and bonds.

7.  **Current Tax Assets:** These are advance tax payments. They are similar to prepaid expenses and will be adjusted once the final tax assessment is completed.

8.  **Other Non-Current Assets:** This is a catch-all category for miscellaneous non-current assets that don't fit into other categories.

# Current Assets

## What are Current Assets?

Current assets are resources that a company expects to convert to cash, sell, or consume within one year or one operating cycle (whichever is longer). They are essential for day-to-day operations and represent the company's working capital.

## Key Components of Current Assets

1.  **Inventory:** This represents goods held for sale or used in the production process. It comprises:

    *   **Raw Materials:** Materials used in production.
    *   **Work-in-Progress (WIP):** Partially completed goods.
    *   **Finished Goods:** Completed goods ready for sale.

    The flow of inventory follows the operating cycle (or working capital cycle):

    Cash → Raw Materials → WIP → Finished Goods → Receivables → Cash

2.  **Financial Assets (Current):** This category includes assets of a financial nature expected to be realized within one year.

    *   **Trade Receivables (Accounts Receivable):** Amounts due from customers for goods or services sold on credit to be recieved within credit period.
        *   **Credit Period:** The time allowed for customers to pay (e.g., 15-180 days).
        *   **Provision for Doubtful Debts (Allowance for Bad Debts):** An estimate of receivables that may not be collected. This is deducted from gross receivables to arrive at net receivables.
        *   **Analysis of Receivables:** The percentage of doubtful debts relative to total receivables is an important indicator of credit risk. An increasing percentage may suggest a need to tighten credit policies.
        *   **Example:** If 3% of total receivables are deemed doubtful in the current year compared to 2% in the previous year, it signals a potential issue.

3.  **Investments (Current):** These are short-term investments that mature within one year. This contrasts with non-current investments, which have longer maturities. Details of investments are usually provided in a separate schedule.

4.  **Cash and Cash Equivalents and Balances with Banks:**

    *   **Cash:** Physical currency.
    *   **Cash Equivalents:** Short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to cash (e.g., unused stamps, stamped paper).
    *   **Bank Balances:** Funds held in current accounts, savings accounts, and term deposits (fixed deposits).
    *   **Unpaid Dividends:** Dividends declared but not yet paid to shareholders (due to incorrect bank details, etc.). These are held in a separate account and eventually transferred to the Investor Protection Fund of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) after a specified period. SEBI is the regulatory body for the Indian capital market.

5.  **Loans and Advances (Current):** Amounts due from others (excluding trade receivables), expected to be collected within one year.

6.  **Other Financial Assets (Current):** A catch-all category for other current financial assets not classified elsewhere.
