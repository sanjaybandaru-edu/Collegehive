# Accounting for Intangible Assets


## Valuation of Intangible Assets

Generally, the value of a *purchased* intangible asset is equal to the amount paid to acquire it. Costs incurred in *internally developing* intangible assets are usually expensed as incurred, except for certain development costs that meet specific criteria.

**Example:**

*   **Purchased Brand:** If a company buys a brand for ₹10 crore, the brand's value is recorded at ₹10 crore.
*   **Internally Developed Brand:** If a company spends ₹5 crore building a brand, this amount is expensed each year as it is spent, not capitalized as an asset.

## Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization is the process of allocating the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. This is similar to depreciation for tangible assets.

*   **Limited Life Intangible Assets:** These are amortized over their useful life or legal life, whichever is shorter.
    *   **Patent:** A patent has a legal life of 20 years. However, if its useful life is estimated to be only 6 years, it is amortized over 6 years.
*   **Indefinite Life Intangible Assets:** These are *not* amortized. Instead, they are tested for *impairment* annually or more frequently if events indicate a potential decline in value.
    *   **Brands:** Brands with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing.
    *   **Goodwill:** Goodwill, arising from the acquisition of another company where the purchase price exceeds the fair value of net identifiable assets, is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing.

## Leasehold Improvements

When a company leases an asset and makes improvements to it, these improvements are capitalized and amortized over the *shorter* of the lease term or the useful life of the improvement.

**Example:**

*   Lease Term: 20 years
*   Cost of Building on Leased Land: ₹50 crore
*   Useful Life of Building: 50 years

The building is amortized over 20 years (the lease term), resulting in an annual amortization expense of ₹2.5 crore (₹50 crore / 20 years).

## Research and Development (R&D) Costs

Accounting for R&D costs varies:

*   **Research Costs:** Generally expensed as incurred.
*   **Development Costs:** May be capitalized if certain criteria are met:
    *   Technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset for use or sale.
    *   Intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.
    *   Ability to use or sell the intangible asset.
    *   How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
    *   Availability of adequate technical, financial, and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.
    *   Ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

**Software Development Costs:** These are often capitalized *after* technological feasibility has been established (usually when a working prototype is available).

|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Patent                | Amortized over useful/legal life (whichever is shorter) | Acquisition cost                                                  |
| Brand (Indefinite)     | Impairment testing      | Acquisition cost                                                  |
| Goodwill              | Impairment testing      | Excess of purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets |
| Leasehold Improvements | Amortized over shorter of lease term or useful life    | Improvement cost                                                  |
| Research Costs        | Expensed as incurred      | N/A                                                               |
| Development Costs     | Capitalized if criteria met, otherwise expensed     | Development costs meeting capitalization criteria                   |
