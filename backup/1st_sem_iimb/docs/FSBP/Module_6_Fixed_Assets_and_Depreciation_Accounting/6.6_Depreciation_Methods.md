# Depreciation Methods: A Deeper Dive

This document expands on depreciation methods, including the straight-line method, written-down value (declining balance) method, sum-of-the-years' digits (SYD) method, and conventions for partial-year depreciation and multiple shifts.

## Straight-Line Method

*   **Assumption:** Equal benefit/productivity from the asset throughout its useful life.
*   **Formula:** (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
*   **Limitation:** Doesn't account for declining productivity or increasing maintenance costs over time.

## Written-Down Value (Declining Balance) Method

*   **Concept:** Higher depreciation expense in early years, gradually decreasing over time. Reflects declining productivity or increasing maintenance.
*   **Calculation:**

*   **Example:**
    *   Cost: ₹9 lakhs (₹10 lakhs - ₹1 lakh salvage value)
    *   Depreciation Rate: 30%
    *   Year 1 Depreciation: ₹9 lakhs * 30% = ₹2.7 lakhs
    *   Year 1 Net Book Value: ₹9 lakhs - ₹2.7 lakhs = ₹6.3 lakhs
    *   Year 2 Depreciation: ₹6.3 lakhs * 30% = ₹1.89 lakhs
    *   And so on...
*   **Key Feature:** The asset's book value never reaches zero using this method, though it gets very close.
*   **Switching to Straight-Line:** To fully depreciate the asset, you can switch to the straight-line method in the later years.

## Sum-of-the-Years' Digits (SYD) Method

*   **Concept:** Another accelerated depreciation method that combines elements of straight-line and declining balance.
*   **Calculation:**
    1.  Calculate the sum of the years' digits: N * (N + 1) / 2, where N is the useful life.
    2.  For each year, the depreciation rate is a fraction: (Remaining Useful Life) / (Sum of the Years' Digits)
*   **Example:**
    *   Asset value =  150000
    *   Useful Life (N): 5 years
    *   Sum of Years' Digits: 5 * (5 + 1) / 2 = 15

*   **Key Feature:** The asset's book value will reach zero at the end of its useful life.

## Partial-Year Depreciation

When an asset is purchased or sold during the year, depreciation needs to be prorated. Common conventions include:

1.  **Pro Rata:** Calculate depreciation based on the number of months the asset was in service.

    *   Example: Asset purchased in February, fiscal year ends in March. Depreciation rate is 12%. Two months' depreciation is (12%/12) * 2 = 2%.

2.  **Half-Year/Full-Year Convention:**
    *   If the asset is in use for 180 days (6 months) or more, charge a full year's depreciation.
    *   If the asset is in use for less than 180 days, charge half a year's depreciation.

3.  **Half-Year Convention (US):** Regardless of the purchase/sale date, 50% of the normal depreciation is charged in the first year and the remaining 50% when the asset is disposed of. This smooths out depreciation over time assuming consistent asset purchases.

## Depreciation for Multiple Shifts

If an asset is used for multiple shifts, the depreciation rate is often increased to reflect the accelerated wear and tear. A common industry practice is to add 50% to the depreciation rate for each additional shift.

*   Example: 10% depreciation for one shift, 15% for two shifts, 20% for three shifts.

## Example Comparison (Straight-Line vs. Declining Balance)

*   Asset Value: ₹10 lakhs
*   Useful Life: 10 years (Used for 12 years then sold for ₹50,000)
*   Straight-Line Depreciation Rate: 10%
*   Declining Balance Depreciation Rate: 20% (Double Declining Balance)
