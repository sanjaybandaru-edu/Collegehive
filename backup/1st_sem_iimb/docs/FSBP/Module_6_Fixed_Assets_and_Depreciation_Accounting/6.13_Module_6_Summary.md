# Summary of Fixed Asset Valuation and Depreciation

This document summarizes the key concepts discussed regarding the valuation and depreciation of fixed assets, including both tangible and intangible assets.

## Asset Classification

Assets are broadly classified into:

*   **Tangible Assets:** Physical assets like land, buildings, and machinery.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Non-physical assets like goodwill, patents, and copyrights.

## Cost Concept and Materiality

*   **Cost Concept:** Fixed assets are recorded at their historical cost, which includes all costs necessary to bring the asset into its intended use.
*   **Materiality Concept:** If the value of an asset is insignificant (immaterial), it can be expensed immediately rather than capitalized and depreciated.

## Depreciation Methods

Several methods are used to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life:

1.  **Straight-Line Method:**
    *   Depreciation expense is constant each year.
    *   Formula: (Asset Cost - Salvage Value) / Service Life

2.  **Written-Down Value (Declining Balance) Method:**
    *   Higher depreciation expense in early years, declining over time.
    *   Depreciation is calculated as a percentage of the asset's net book value each year.

3.  **Sum-of-the-Years' Digits (SYD) Method:**
    *   Another accelerated depreciation method.
    *   Depreciation is calculated based on a fraction derived from the remaining useful life and the sum of the years' digits.

## Asset Disposal and Exchanges

When an asset is disposed of (sold or exchanged), specific accounting entries are required:

*   **Sale of Asset:**
    *   Remove the asset's cost and accumulated depreciation.
    *   Record cash received.
    *   Recognize any gain or loss on disposal (Sale Price - Net Book Value).

*   **Exchange of Similar Assets:**
    *   No gain or loss is recognized.
    *   The new asset's cost is the net book value of the old asset plus any cash paid.

*   **Exchange of Dissimilar Assets:**
    *   The exchange is treated as a sale and a purchase.
    *   A gain or loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset received and the net book value of the asset given up.

## Group Depreciation

When dealing with a large number of similar, low-value assets, group depreciation simplifies accounting:

*   The entire group is treated as a single unit.
*   A single depreciation rate is applied to the total cost of the group.
*   No gain or loss is recognized on the disposal of individual assets within the group. Adjustments are made to accumulated depreciation.

## Accounting for Natural Resources (Depletion)

Accounting for natural resources involves depletion, not depreciation:

*   **Purchased Resources:** Depletion is calculated based on the quantity extracted.
*   **Exploration and Development:**
    *   **Full Cost Method:** All exploration costs (successful and unsuccessful) are capitalized.
    *   **Successful Efforts Method:** Only successful exploration costs are capitalized; unsuccessful costs are expensed.

## Accounting for Intangible Assets (Amortization)

*   **Limited Life Intangibles:** Amortized over their useful or legal life (whichever is shorter).
*   **Indefinite Life Intangibles:** Not amortized, but tested for impairment.
*   **Leasehold Improvements:** Amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the improvement.
*   **Research and Development (R&D):** Research costs are expensed. Development costs may be capitalized if specific criteria are met. Software development costs are often capitalized after technological feasibility is established.
