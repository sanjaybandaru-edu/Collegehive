* **Capital Raising:** Companies can raise capital from the public, while sole proprietorships rely on the owner's resources and partnerships on partners' contributions.

* **Control/Voting Rights:** Companies' voting rights are proportional to share ownership. Cooperatives offer one vote per member, promoting democratic control.
