# Liquidity Risk and Current Ratio

## Liquidity Risk or Short term solvency risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that a company will not be able to meet its short-term obligations. It's the risk of not having enough readily available assets to cover immediate liabilities.

## Current Ratio

The current ratio is a key metric used to assess liquidity risk. It is calculated as:

**Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**

*   **Current Assets:** Assets that can be converted into cash within one year (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory).
*   **Current Liabilities:** Obligations due within one year (e.g., accounts payable, short-term debt).

**Analysis of Current Ratio:**

| Metric             | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| Current Assets      | 60     | 90     |
| Current Liabilities | 10     | 20     |
| Current Ratio       | 6      | 4.5    |

**Observations:**

*   The current ratio decreased from 6 to 4.5 between Year 1 and Year 2.
*   A current ratio of 2 or higher is generally considered a healthy sign of liquidity.
*   Both Year 1 and Year 2 have current ratios well above 2, indicating good liquidity in both periods.

## The Significance of a Current Ratio of 2

The "magic number" of 2 is a rule of thumb based on the principle of having a sufficient buffer to cover short-term liabilities even if some current assets are not fully realized or collected.

**Illustrative Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Trading Business with 1:1 Current Ratio**

*   Buy 2 units @ 100 each, sell @ 110 each (5-day credit for both purchases and sales).
*   Day 1: Current Assets = 220, Current Liabilities = 200, Current Ratio = 1.1
*   Repeating this for 5 days maintains a 1.1 ratio.

**Problem:** If customer payments are delayed, the company may not have enough cash to pay its suppliers on day 6, even though the business is profitable. This illustrates the risk associated with a low current ratio.

**Scenario 2: Trading Business with 2:1 Current Ratio**

*   Invest 100 daily (own capital) and buy 2 units @ 100 each.
*   Avail credit for only one unit (100) and pay for the other unit (100) from own capital.
*   Sell 2 units @ 110 each (5-day credit).
*   Day 1: Current Assets = 220, Current Liabilities = 100, Current Ratio = 2.2
*   Repeating this maintains a 2.2 ratio.

**Benefit:** On day 6, even if only one of the two customers pays, the company can still cover its 100 liability to the supplier. This scenario demonstrates that a current ratio of 2 provides a buffer and reduces the reliance on 100% collection of receivables.

**Probability of Collection:**

A current ratio of 2 implies that the company needs to collect only 50% of its outstanding receivables to meet its current obligations. This can be derived as follows:

Probability of Collection Required = 1 / Current Ratio

In the example with a current ratio of 2:

Probability of Collection Required = 1 / 2 = 50%

**Application to the Analyzed Company:**

With current ratios of 6 and 4.5, the company has a much larger buffer than the minimum 2 and requires a much lower probability of collection to meet its obligations. This indicates strong short-term liquidity.
# Long-Term Solvency Analysis


## Debt-to-Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity ratio measures the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt compared to equity.

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity**

*   Historically, a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1 or lower was considered acceptable.
*   Currently, investors often prefer a ratio closer to 1:1, viewing higher ratios as riskier.
*   However, there's no universally "ideal" ratio. It varies significantly by industry. Capital-intensive industries like infrastructure tend to have higher debt-to-equity ratios.

**Analysis:**

| Metric             | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| Total Debt (Loan Value) | 40     | 180    |
| Total Equity        | 100    | 100    |
| Debt-to-Equity Ratio | 0.4    | 1.8    |

The debt to equity ratio has increased from 0.4 to 1.8.

## Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

DSCR measures a company's ability to cover its debt obligations with its operating income.

**DSCR = (Profit Before Depreciation, Interest, and Taxes (PBDIT) - Taxes) / (Interest Expense + Loan Installment)**

*   Assuming a 5-year loan repayment period, the annual installment is 20% of the loan value.

**Analysis:**

| Metric                                      | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| PBDIT                                      | 16     | 149    |
| Taxes                                       | 2      | 25     |
| PBDIT - Taxes                             | 14     | 124    |
| Interest Expense                           | 5      | 20     |
| Loan Value                                  | 40     | 180    |
| Loan Installment (Loan Value / 5)           | 8      | 36     |
| Interest + Loan Installment                | 13     | 56     |
| DSCR ((PBDIT - Taxes) / (Interest + Installment)) | 1.08 | 2.21 |

**Observations:**

*   A DSCR greater than 1 is generally considered adequate, indicating the company generates enough income to cover its debt obligations.
*   Both Year 1 and Year 2 have DSCRs greater than 1, showing good long-term solvency.

## Altman Z-Score

The Altman Z-score is a widely used credit-strength test that predicts the probability of a company going bankrupt. It combines five financial ratios, each weighted by a coefficient.

**Altman Z-Score Formula:**

Z = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E

Where:

*   A = Working Capital / Total Assets
*   B = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
*   C = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Total Assets (Same as PBIT/Total Assets or ROTA)
*   D = Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities
*   E = Sales / Total Assets

**Analysis:**

| Ratio                                | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Working Capital / Total Assets       | (60-10)/150 = 0.33 | (90-20)/300 = 0.23 |
| Retained Earnings / Total Assets     | Assuming initial RE of 0 for simplicity, RE in Y1 = 9, RE in Y2 = 104, so RE/TA for Y1 = 9/150 = 0.06, RE/TA for Y2 = 104/300 = 0.35 | 0.06 | 0.35 |
| PBIT / Total Assets (ROTA)           | 10.67% or 0.1067 | 49.67% or 0.4967 |
| Equity / Total Debt               | 100/40 = 2.5 | 100/180 = 0.56 |
| Sales / Total Assets                 | Assuming sales of 100 in Y1 and 300 in Y2 (since cost ratios are based on sales), so sales/TA for Y1 = 100/150=0.67, sales/TA for Y2 = 300/300=1 | 0.67 | 1 |
| **Z-Score Calculation** | (1.2 \* 0.33) + (1.4 \* 0.06) + (3.3 \* 0.1067) + (0.6 \* 2.5) + (1 \* 0.67) = 0.4 + 0.084 + 0.35 + 1.5 + 0.67 = 3.004 | (1.2 \* 0.23) + (1.4 \* 0.35) + (3.3 \* 0.4967) + (0.6 \* 0.56) + (1 \* 1) = 0.276 + 0.49 + 1.64 + 0.336 + 1 = 3.742 |

**Note:** The Retained Earnings and Sales values were estimated to perform the Z-score calculation. Precise data would provide a more accurate result.

**Interpretation:**

*   A Z-score above 2.675 indicates a low probability of financial distress.
*   Both years have Z-scores above 2.675, suggesting good long-term financial health.
