# Asset  Management

## 1. Asset Turnover Ratio

The **asset turnover ratio** measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue. It answers the question: "For every rupee invested in assets, how much revenue is generated?"

*   **Formula:** Asset Turnover Ratio = Sales / Total Assets

**Example :**

**Calculations:**

*   **Year 1:** Asset Turnover Ratio = 180 / 150 = 1.2
*   **Year 2:** Asset Turnover Ratio = 600 / 300 = 2.0

**Analysis:**

The asset turnover ratio improved significantly from 1.2 to 2.0. This means that for every rupee invested in assets, the company generated ₹1.2 in revenue in Year 1 and ₹2.0 in Year 2. This indicates a substantial improvement in asset productivity.
# Cost Management, Profit Margin, and Drivers of ROTA


## 1. Cost Management and Cost to Sales Ratio

To assess cost management effectiveness, we use the **cost to sales ratio**:

*   **Formula:** Cost to Sales Ratio = Total Expenses / Sales

**Example:**

* Using the same table of balance sheet and profit and loss as before.

**Calculations:**

*   **Year 1:** Cost to Sales Ratio = 164 / 180 = 0.9111 or 91.11%
*   **Year 2:** Cost to Sales Ratio = 451 / 600 = 0.7517 or 75.17%

**Analysis:**

The cost to sales ratio decreased from 91.11% to 75.17%. This means that for every ₹100 of sales, the company spent ₹91.11 on expenses in Year 1 and ₹75.17 in Year 2, demonstrating improved cost control.

## 2. Profit Margin

Instead of the cost to sales ratio, we can also use the **profit margin** to measure profitability relative to sales:

*   **Formula:** Profit Margin = PBIT / Sales

**Calculations (Using the previous example):**

*   **Year 1:** Profit Margin = 16 / 180 = 0.0889 or 8.89%
*   **Year 2:** Profit Margin = 149 / 600 = 0.2483 or 24.83%

**Analysis:**

The profit margin improved significantly from 8.89% to 24.83%, nearly tripling. This indicates that the company generated more profit for every rupee of sales in Year 2.

## 3. Relationship between ROTA, Asset Turnover, and Profit Margin

A fundamental relationship in financial analysis is:

*   **ROTA = Asset Turnover Ratio * Profit Margin**

**Verification (Using the previous example):**

*   **Year 1:** 1.2 * 8.89% = 10.67% (approximately equals the calculated ROTA of 10.67%)
*   **Year 2:** 2.0 * 24.83% = 49.66% (approximately equals the calculated ROTA of 49.67%) (Slight rounding differences may occur)

This formula highlights that ROTA is driven by two key factors:

*   **Asset Management (Asset Turnover):** How effectively assets are used to generate sales.
*   **Cost Management (Profit Margin):** How effectively costs are controlled relative to sales.

Improving either asset management or cost management (or both) will lead to improved ROTA. In our example, both factors contributed to the superior performance in Year 2.

## 4. Drivers of Asset Turnover

To further understand the drivers of asset turnover, we need to analyze the components of total assets:

*   **Total Assets = Fixed Assets + Current Assets**

**Current Assets** typically include:

*   Inventory
*   Receivables (Accounts Receivable)
*   Cash and Bank Balances

By analyzing the turnover of each of these asset categories (e.g., inventory turnover, receivables turnover), we can pinpoint specific areas where asset management improved or declined. This further drill-down analysis will be covered in the following sections.
# Analyzing Asset Productivity: Fixed Asset Turnover, Current Asset Turnover, Inventory Days, and Receivable Days
## 1. Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio

The **fixed asset turnover ratio** measures how efficiently a company uses its fixed assets (e.g., property, plant, and equipment) to generate sales.

*   **Formula:** Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = Sales / Net Fixed Assets

**Example:**

![Screenshot (339)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17d6fe43-fc2c-40b1-9bf8-1983ed4db61c)


**Calculations:**

*   **Year 1:** Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = 180 / 90 = 2.0
*   **Year 2:** Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = 600 / 210 = 2.86 (approximately)

**Analysis:**

The fixed asset turnover ratio improved from 2.0 to 2.86, indicating that the company generated more sales per rupee invested in fixed assets in Year 2.

## 2. Current Asset Turnover Ratio

The **current asset turnover ratio** measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets (e.g., inventory, receivables, cash) to generate sales.

*   **Formula:** Current Asset Turnover Ratio = Sales / Current Assets

**Calculations:**

*   **Year 1:** Current Asset Turnover Ratio = 180 / 60 = 3.0
*   **Year 2:** Current Asset Turnover Ratio = 600 / 90 = 6.67 (approximately)

**Analysis:**

The current asset turnover ratio improved significantly from 3.0 to 6.67, demonstrating improved management of current assets in Year 2.

## 3. Inventory Days (Days Sales of Inventory)

**Inventory days** (also called days sales of inventory or average inventory period) measures how long it takes a company to sell its inventory.

*   **Formula:** Inventory Days = Inventory / (Cost of Goods Sold or Total Expenses / 365)

*Using Total Expenses as a proxy for Cost of Goods Sold in this simplified example.*

**Calculations:**

*   **Year 1:** Inventory Days = 20 / (164 / 365) = 20 / 0.45 = 44.44 days (approximately)
*   **Year 2:** Inventory Days = 30 / (451 / 365) = 30 / 1.24 = 24.19 days (approximately)

**Analysis:**

Inventory days decreased from approximately 44 days to 24 days, indicating that the company is selling its inventory much faster in Year 2. This is a positive sign of improved inventory management.

## 4. Receivable Days (Days Sales Outstanding)

**Receivable days** (also called days sales outstanding or average collection period) measures how long it takes a company to collect payments from its customers.

*   **Formula:** Receivable Days = Receivables / (Sales / 365)

**Calculations:**

*   **Year 1:** Receivable Days = 30 / (180 / 365) = 30 / 0.49 = 61.22 days (approximately)
*   **Year 2:** Receivable Days = 50 / (600 / 365) = 50 / 1.64 = 30.49 days (approximately)

**Analysis:**

Receivable days decreased significantly from approximately 61 days to 30 days, indicating that the company is collecting payments from its customers much faster in Year 2. This is a positive sign of improved receivables management.
# Cost Ratio Analysis and Profitability Drivers

This document analyzes the company's cost performance using cost ratios and discusses the key drivers contributing to improved profitability, including leverage management.

## Cost Ratio Analysis

Cost ratios are calculated by dividing each expense by sales. The following table summarizes the changes in cost ratios from Year 1 to Year 2:

![Screenshot (344)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/793c708f-b429-4d11-8a73-900938f6db84)

**Key Observations:**

*   **Significant Reductions:** The company achieved substantial cost reductions in material, employee, other expenses, and depreciation.
*   **Material Cost:** A 5.56% reduction indicates improved efficiency in procurement, production, or inventory management.
*   **Employee Cost:** A nearly 7% reduction suggests better workforce management, potentially through increased productivity or optimized staffing levels.
*   **Other Expenses:** A decrease of 1.66% signifies effective control over miscellaneous operational costs.
*   **Depreciation:** Although the depreciation rate remained constant at 10% of asset value, the depreciation-to-sales ratio decreased due to increased asset productivity. This implies that the assets are generating more sales revenue for the same amount of depreciation.
*   **Interest Cost:** The only increase was in interest cost, which rose by 0.55% due to higher borrowings.

## Impact on Profitability

The efficient management of these costs significantly contributed to an increase in the return on total assets (ROTA) from 10.67% to 49.67%. This demonstrates a strong correlation between cost control and profitability.

## Profitability Drivers

The analysis identifies three key profitability drivers:

1.  **Cost Management:** As detailed above, effective cost control across various expense categories played a crucial role in enhancing profitability.
2.  **Asset Management:** Improved asset productivity, reflected in the reduced depreciation-to-sales ratio, contributed to higher returns.
3.  **Leverage Management:** This involves using funds provided by others (liabilities) to improve profitability. Leverage can be divided into two components:

    *   **Impact of Payables** 
    *   **Impact of Debt**
