# Accounting for Company

A company is a legal entity that is formed by a group of people to conduct business and earn profits. Capital is contributed by shareholders represented by share capital account.


## Scenario: Alpha Limited

Alpha Limited, initially funded with ₹50 crore by promoters, issues 100 lakh equity shares with a face value of ₹10 each at a premium of ₹90 per share (total issue price ₹100). The payment schedule is:

*   Application: ₹5
*   Allotment: ₹45(Entire premium)
*   First and Final Call: ₹50( 5 as share capital and 45 as premium)

Investors applied for 400 lakh shares (4 times the offer). Alpha Limited allots only 100 lakh shares and refunds the application money for the remaining 300 lakh shares.All those allotted shares paid the allotment money of 45 rupees per share.  After six months, Alpha Limited made the first and final call and asked the shareholders to pay the balance of Rs. 50 per share. Only 95 lakh shareholders paid the first and final call. Even after repeated reminders, the balance 5 lakh shareholders have not responded.The company forfeited the shares and decided to cancel their share allotment and forfeit the
allotment amount received from those shareholders.

**Explanation of Forfeiture:**

When shares are forfeited, the company cancels the shares and keeps the money already received. This amount is credited to the "Forfeited Shares Account," which is part of equity. The original share capital and premium are reversed for the forfeited shares. The balance due on the call is also reversed.
