# Retirement of a Partner and Goodwill Valuation

## Scenario

Mr. Ram retires from a partnership after three years. The firm's profits for the three years are:

*   Year 1: ₹50 lakhs
*   Year 2: ₹80 lakhs
*   Year 3: ₹140 lakhs

The partners agree to value goodwill at five times the average profit of the three years.
We will Calculate the incremental goodwill between year 1 and 3 to be allocated to all the partners at Ram’s retirement and balance in Ram’s capital account that needs to be paid off at the time of his retirement. Assume Ram will pay his current account balance separately to the firm.
## Goodwill Calculation

1.  **Average Profit:** (₹50 lakhs + ₹80 lakhs + ₹140 lakhs) / 3 = ₹90 lakhs
2.  **Goodwill Value:** ₹90 lakhs * 5 = ₹450 lakhs

It's stated that the goodwill value at the end of year 1 was ₹150 lakhs. Therefore, the *increase* in goodwill over the three years is ₹450 lakhs - ₹150 lakhs = ₹300 lakhs.

## Goodwill Distribution

The increase in goodwill (₹300 lakhs) is distributed among the partners according to their profit-sharing ratio:

*   Ram: 33.35% 
*   Krishna: 50.03%
*   Rahul: 16.62%

## New Profit-Sharing Ratio

After Ram's retirement, the new profit-sharing ratio between Krishna and Rahul will be based on their respective capital account balances *after the goodwill adjustment*. 
*  Krishna's share = 410.62/547.06*100= 75.06%
*  Rahul's share = 136.44/547.06*100= 24.94%
