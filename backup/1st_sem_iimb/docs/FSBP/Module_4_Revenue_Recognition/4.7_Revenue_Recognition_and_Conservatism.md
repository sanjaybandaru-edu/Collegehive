# Conservatism in Revenue Recognition and Loss Recognition

Conservatism is a key accounting principle that requires recognizing losses as soon as they are probable, but delaying the recognition of gains until they are realized. This principle is particularly relevant in long-term projects and installment sales.

## Impact of Conservatism on Different Revenue Recognition Methods

This document explores how conservatism affects various revenue recognition methods, especially when a project is projected to incur a loss. The methods discussed are:

*   **Percentage of Completion Method:** Revenue is recognized based on the percentage of work completed.
*   **Completed Contract Method:** Revenue is recognized only when the contract is completed.
*   **Cost First Recovery Method:** Revenue is recognized only after all costs have been recovered.
*   **Installment Method:** Profit is recognized proportionally to cash collections.

## Loss Recognition During Project Execution

Let's consider a scenario where a project initially estimated to generate a profit ultimately incurs a loss.

**Example:**

*   Contract Value: ₹120 crore
*   Initial Estimated Cost: ₹100 crore
*   Revised Estimated Cost (after 2 years): ₹130 crore

This means a projected loss of ₹10 crore (₹130 crore - ₹120 crore).

**Conservatism mandates recognizing this loss immediately when it becomes evident, not waiting until project completion.**

### 1. Completed Contract Method and Cost First Recovery Method

Under these methods, no profit is recognized until the project is complete. However, when a loss becomes apparent, it must be recognized immediately.

*   **Entry in Year 2:**
    *   Debit: Provision for Estimated Loss ₹10 crore
    *   Credit: Expenses ₹10 crore

This creates a liability (Provision for Estimated Loss) and recognizes the loss in the income statement of Year 2. In Year 3, the provision account is adjusted against the actual loss.

### 2. Percentage of Completion Method

This method recognizes profit based on the percentage of completion. If a loss is projected, any previously recognized profit must be reversed, and the remaining loss recognized.

**Example (Continuing from above):**

*   Year 1 Profit (recognized): ₹4 crore
*   Year 2 Expenses: ₹40 crore
*   Year 2 Revenue (based on completion): ₹26 crore (assumed)

*   **Year 2 Calculation:**
    *   Loss = Expenses - Revenue = ₹40 crore - ₹26 crore = ₹14 crore
    *   Total Loss to be recognized in Year 2 = Previous Profit + Current Loss = ₹4 crore+₹10 crore = ₹14 crore
*   Year 3 expenses are 70 crore and revenue is 70 crore, resulting in zero profit.
*   Total loss is 10 crore (4 crore profit in year 1 - 14 crore loss in year 2 + 0 profit in year 3)

### 3. Installment Method

This method recognizes profit proportionally to cash collections. When a loss is projected, previously recognized profit must be reversed, and the remaining loss recognized.

**Example (Continuing from above):**

*   Year 1 Profit (recognized): ₹1.67 crore
*   Total projected Loss: ₹10 crore
*   Total Loss to recognize in Year 2: ₹1.67 crore + ₹10 crore = ₹11.67 crore
*   Year 2 Revenue (based on collections): ₹20 crore
*   Year 2 Expenses: ₹31.67 crore (to reflect the ₹11.67 crore loss)
*   The difference between the actual cash spent (40 crore) and the expenses recognized (31.67 crore) is added to the Work in Progress (WIP) account (8.33 crore).
*   In year three, expenses of 30 crore are recognized against revenue of 30 crore, resulting in zero profit. The remaining 40 crore spent is added to WIP.
*   In the following years (year 4 and 5), WIP is reduced as revenue is recognized to ensure no further profit or loss is recognized.

**Important Note on Installment Method Example:** The original example used a construction contract for illustrating the installment method, which isn't ideal. The installment method is more appropriate for sales where payments are received over time, even after the product is delivered.

## Proper Example of Installment Sale

**Scenario:**

*   Sale Price of Air Conditioner: ₹60,000
*   Cost of Goods Sold: ₹48,000
*   Gross Profit: ₹12,000 (20% of sales price)
*   Payment Terms: 4 quarterly installments of ₹15,000

**Accounting Entries:**

*   **January 1 (Sale):**
    *   Debit: Installment Account Receivable ₹60,000
    *   Credit: Inventory ₹48,000
    *   Credit: Deferred Gross Profit ₹12,000
*   **March 31 (First Installment):**
    *   Debit: Cash ₹15,000
    *   Credit: Installment Account Receivable ₹15,000
    *   Debit: Deferred Gross Profit ₹3,000 (20% of ₹15,000)
    *   Credit: Cost of Sales ₹12,000
    *   Credit: Revenue ₹15,000
*   This process is repeated for the remaining three quarters, recognizing ₹3,000 profit each quarter.

This example illustrates the proper application of the installment method, where profit is recognized proportionally to cash collections.

## Conclusion

Conservatism plays a crucial role in revenue recognition, especially in long-term projects and installment sales. It mandates the immediate recognition of losses when they become probable, ensuring that financial statements present a realistic view of the company's financial position. The specific application of conservatism varies depending on the revenue recognition method used.
