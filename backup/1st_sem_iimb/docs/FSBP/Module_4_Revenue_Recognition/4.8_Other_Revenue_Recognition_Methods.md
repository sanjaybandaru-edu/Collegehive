# Other Revenue Recognition Methods

Besides the previously mentioned methods, here are some additional revenue recognition methods:

## 1. Production Method

*   This method refers to recognizing revenue based on the production or completion of goods, rather than their sale or delivery. This method is typically used in industries where the production process itself generates value, such as mining, agriculture, fishing, etc.
*   If the accounting period falls between the production period and actual sales, then we will recognize the revenue in the current year based on either the support price set by the government (in the case of agriculture) or by market prices (in other cases).
*   We will show them as sales income on the revenue side and accrued revenue on the asset side.

**Input Method:** This is another method related to the production method. This method is used by companies that execute a project on a time and material basis.

## 2. Revenue Recognition by Franchise Business

*   A franchise refers to a business model where a person called the franchisee runs a local branch of a larger established company.
*   The franchisee pays the franchisor a fee and agrees to use the franchisor’s name and trademarks for a set period of time.

**Example:** Mr. Sharma received a contract from McDonald's where he paid ₹1 crore to the Franchisor on 15th January 2020. It took them almost 8 months to set up the business, and it finally commenced on 20th September 2020.

**When should the revenue be recognized?**

**Solution:** The revenue will be recognized in the accounting year 2020-21 and not 2019-20. This will oppose the conservatism concept (which would suggest recognizing revenue later rather than sooner). The key event for revenue recognition here is the commencement of operations (when the franchisor has substantially performed its obligations), not the upfront payment.

## 3. Consignment Sales

*   Consignment sales are a business arrangement where a product owner (consignor) gives their goods to a third party (the consignee) to sell on their behalf.

* Example:

  * Here 1st person is Customer, 2nd is Consignee and 3rd is consignor.
  * Here the consignor gave the goods to consignee and makes the following entries in different cases:-
