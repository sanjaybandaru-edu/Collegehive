# Inventory Accounting in Service Industries
## 1. Inventory in Different Industries

*   **Manufacturing Industries:** Have all three inventory components:
    *   Raw materials
    *   Work-in-progress (WIP)
    *   Finished goods
*   **Service Industries:** Generally only have work-in-progress (WIP). Some pure service firms may not even have WIP.

## 2. Work-in-Progress (WIP) in Service Industries

WIP in service industries represents the cost of services that have been started but not yet completed and delivered to the client.

### 2.1 Job Cost Sheets

Service industries that execute specific jobs or projects for clients use **job cost sheets** to track costs. A job cost sheet is a record of all expenses associated with a particular project.
