# Inventory Accounting and Valuation

## Importance of Inventory Valuation

Accurate inventory valuation is crucial for determining a business's profit. The cost of goods manufactured (COGM) is calculated as:

COGM = Total Manufacturing Expenses - Value of Closing Inventory

An incorrect inventory valuation directly impacts the reported profit:

*   **Overvaluation of Inventory:** Overstates profit.
*   **Undervaluation of Inventory:** Understates profit.

## Inventory Valuation Methods

There are two main approaches to inventory valuation:

1.  **Periodic Inventory Valuation:** A physical count of inventory is conducted at the end of an accounting period to determine the closing inventory value.

2.  **Perpetual Inventory Valuation:** Purchases and issues of inventory are continuously recorded, allowing for the determination of inventory balance (quantity and value) after each transaction. This provides a real-time view of inventory.

## Inventory Cost Flow Assumptions (for Frequent Procurements with Varying Rates)

When items are procured frequently at different prices, it's necessary to make assumptions about how costs flow through inventory. The most common methods are:

1.  **First-In, First-Out (FIFO):** Assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold first. This method is often used for perishable goods.

2.  **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO):** Assumes that the newest inventory items are sold first. LIFO is not permitted under IFRS.

3.  **Weighted Average Method:** Calculates a weighted average cost for all inventory items and uses this average cost to value issues and ending inventory. This simplifies record-keeping compared to FIFO and LIFO.

4.  **Specific Identification Method:** This method is used when each inventory item can be uniquely identified (e.g., high-value items with serial numbers). The actual cost of each item sold is tracked.

## Retail Method

The retail method is used by retail businesses. It estimates the cost of goods sold (COGS) by:

COGS = Total Sales Value - Average Gross Margin

## Inventory Accounts for Manufacturing Companies

Manufacturing companies typically use separate inventory accounts:

*   **Raw Materials:** Materials used in the production process.
*   **Work-in-Progress (WIP):** Partially completed goods.
*   **Finished Goods:** Completed goods ready for sale.

Accountants track the value added at each stage as materials move from raw materials to WIP and then to finished goods.

## Inventory Accounting for Service Firms

Inventory accounting for service firms is simpler. A "job cost sheet" is used to track all expenses incurred for a specific job. The value of closing WIP is the sum of the costs on all incomplete job cost sheets.

## Importance of Accurate Inventory Valuation and Auditing

Incorrect inventory valuation is a common area for accounting fraud, as it can be used to manipulate reported profits. Auditors pay close attention to inventory accounting and valuation procedures during audits to ensure the financial statements are fairly presented.
