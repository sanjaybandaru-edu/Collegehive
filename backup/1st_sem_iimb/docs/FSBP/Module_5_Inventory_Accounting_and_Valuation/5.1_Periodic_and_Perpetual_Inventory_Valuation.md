Periodic and Perpetual Inventory System

# Inventory Accounting for Trading and Manufacturing Firms

This module discusses inventory accounting methods for both trading (merchandising) and manufacturing firms, focusing on periodic and perpetual inventory systems.

## Trading (Merchandising) Firms

Trading firms buy and sell goods without adding value through production. Inventory accounting is simpler for these firms, with the main challenge being fluctuating purchase prices.

### Example: Television Sales

A company purchases televisions in three lots:

*   Lot 1: 30 units @ ₹10,000/unit
*   Lot 2: 40 units @ ₹9,000/unit
*   Lot 3: 30 units @ ₹11,000/unit

Total purchase value: (30\*10,000) + (40\*9,000) + (30\*11,000) = ₹990,000

The company sells 80 units @ ₹14,000/unit.

Total sales value: 80 \* ₹14,000 = ₹1,120,000

### Periodic Inventory Valuation

*   **Example (Continuing):** Suppose the ending inventory is valued at ₹220,000.
*   **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Total Purchase Value - Ending Inventory Value = ₹990,000 - ₹220,000 = ₹770,000
*   **Profit:** Sales Value - COGS = ₹1,120,000 - ₹770,000 = ₹350,000

**Suitability:** Periodic inventory is suitable for firms dealing with few items and relatively small ending inventory.

## Manufacturing Firms and Perpetual Inventory

Manufacturing firms use raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods. Physical counting of inventory can be challenging, especially when dealing with numerous components. This is where perpetual inventory accounting becomes essential.

### Perpetual Inventory Accounting

In perpetual inventory accounting, inventory records are updated continuously with each purchase and sale. This provides a real-time view of inventory levels.

### Example: Automobile Component

An automobile company purchases a component at ₹200/unit on the 1st of each month and issues components to production on the 15th.

**Month 1:**

*   Purchase: 500 units @ ₹200 = ₹100,000
*   Issue: 400 units @ ₹200 = ₹80,000

**Month 2:**

*   Purchase: 600 units @ ₹200 = ₹120,000
*   Issue: 500 units @ ₹200 = ₹100,000


**Month 3:**

*   Purchase: 800 units @ ₹200 = ₹160,000
*   Issue: 900 units @ ₹200 = ₹180,000

**Summary:**

*   Total Purchase Value: ₹380,000
*   Total Issue Value: ₹360,000
*   Ending Inventory Value: ₹20,000

### Advantages of Perpetual Inventory

**Suitability:** Perpetual inventory is appropriate when physical counting is not feasible, especially for manufacturing companies with large and complex inventories. It is also suitable when purchase prices vary significantly.
