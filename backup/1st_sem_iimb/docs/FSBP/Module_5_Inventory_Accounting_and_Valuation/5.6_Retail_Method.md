## Retail Method of Inventory Valuation

The retail method is a simplified inventory valuation technique primarily used by retail stores that deal with a large volume of diverse items. 

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Simplified Approach:** Suitable for businesses where detailed physical inventory counts and individual cost tracking are impractical.
* **Focus on Retail Value:** Primarily relies on the retail value of inventory (selling price) rather than cost.
* **Gross Margin Percentage:** Calculates the cost of goods sold based on the estimated gross margin percentage.

**Example:**

* Opening stock (cost): 20 lakhs
* Purchases (cost): 300 lakhs
* Sales revenue: 280 lakhs
* Gross margin percentage: 5%

* Cost of goods sold: 280 lakhs - (280 lakhs * 5%) = 266 lakhs
* Ending inventory: 20 lakhs (opening stock) + 300 lakhs (purchases) - 266 lakhs (cost of goods sold) = 54 lakhs

**Limitations:**

* **Assumes Uniform Gross Margin:** The accuracy of the method relies on the assumption that the gross margin percentage is consistent across all product lines. This assumption may not always hold true.
* **Approximation:** The retail method provides an estimate of the cost of goods sold, not the exact value.
