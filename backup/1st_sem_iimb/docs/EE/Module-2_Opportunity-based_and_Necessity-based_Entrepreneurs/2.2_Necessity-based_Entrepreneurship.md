# Necessity-Based Entrepreneurship

Necessity-based entrepreneurship, also known as survival entrepreneurship is defined as entrepreneurship driven by the need to survive rather than by the pursuit of opportunity. Common in emerging economies, such as India, where high levels of entrepreneurship are observed due to economic challenges.

It is driven by a lack of alternative employment opportunities or income sources. Here individuals turn to  enterpreneurship out of necessity, often due to unemployment, underemployment, economic hardship, or lack of social safety nets. 

The primary goal is to generate income for survival and basic needs which  contrasts with opportunity-based entrepreneurship, where individuals pursue business ventures to capitalize on perceived market opportunities and to distrupt the market.

## Characteristics of Necessity-Based Entrepreneurship:

*   **Resources:** Has limited access to capital, resources, and formal business training. Entrepreneurs may rely on personal savings, informal loans, or microfinance.
*   **Scale:** Typically operates on a small scale, often as sole proprietorships or micro-enterprises. The focus is on immediate income generation rather than long-term expansion.
*   **Sector:** Commonly found in informal sectors, such as street vending, small-scale retail, personal services, and home-based businesses.
*   **Innovation:** While not always the primary focus, necessity can drive innovation in resourcefulness and adaptation to limited resources. Entrepreneurs may find creative ways to utilize available materials and cater to local needs.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Individuals are often willing to take risks due to their limited alternative options. The potential reward of generating income outweighs the risk of failure.
*    **Replication:** It is very common to replicate what someone else is doing in this type of entrepreneurship

## Examples of Necessity-Based Entrepreneurship:

*   **Street vendors:** Selling food, clothing, or other goods in public spaces.

## Micro Finance : Biggest source of finance in Necessity Entrepreneurship

Micro finance was invented/ put together by Prof Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh. He started Grameen Bank and the concept scaled up.
