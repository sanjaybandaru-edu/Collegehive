# Opportunity-Based Entrepreneurship

Pull or Opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by the identification and exploitation of perceived market opportunities. Such entrepreneurs initiate venture activity because of the attractiveness of the business idea and its personal implications. Unlike necessity-based entrepreneurship, which arises from a lack of other employment options, opportunity-based ventures are proactive and focused on creating value by addressing unmet needs or capitalizing on emerging trends.

Opportunity-based entrepreneurship plays a vital role in driving innovation, economic growth, and job creation. By identifying and exploiting market opportunities, entrepreneurs can create valuable businesses that address unmet needs and improve people's lives. While it involves risks and challenges, the potential rewards can be significant, both financially and personally.
