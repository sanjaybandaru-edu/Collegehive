# What is Entrepreneurship?

Entrepreneurship is more than just starting a business. It's a mindset and a process that involves identifying opportunities, taking risks, and creating value. It's about innovation, problem-solving, and building something new. Entrepreneurship is a dynamic and multifaceted process that plays a vital role in economic development, innovation, and social progress.

Entrepreneurship is the foundation of invention, job creation and wealth generation. Entrepreneurs are change-makers, problem-solvers, out-of-the-box thinkers and uncompromising leaders with a vision in mind and mission to make a dent in the universe.

## Origin of Entrepreneurship

*    It is the fundamental aspect of human commerce, existing even before formal communication. The term has gained popularity in recent years, particularly with the rise of start ups and venture capital.
*    We are homo economicus ( we do business ) much before we started to converse with eachother. Our ability to do business, understand commerce, offer things to each other in exchange of what is valuable to one has been there for centuries.
*    **Silent Trade:** Early traders exchanged goods without verbal communication, highlighting the innate human tendency to engage in commerce.

     How does silent trade work?

     For example, traders mostly from Europe go to Africa , put a bunch of products in a particular location, then there would be locals who would come to look at the products, and put gold/ valuable for it and take it, or just go back implying no deal.

*   **Technological Advancements:** Rapid technological advancements over the last century, illustrating how innovations like flight and the internet have transformed society. The comparison between historical and modern conveniences underscores the impact of entrepreneurial ventures on everyday life.
*   **Risk and Capital:** Entrepreneurship involves risk-taking. The distinction between those who provide capital and those who operate businesses is highlighted by Jean-Baptiste Say, marking a shift in understanding entrepreneurship.

## Creative Destruction 

The concept of "creative destruction," introduced by an Australian political economist Joseph Schumpeter, and  explains how new ventures can disrupt established companies.

Creative destruction happens incessantly all the time, continuously. Incessant movement of economy is an outcome of peeps who are entrepreneurial, who want to change things and disrupt

Examples include the decline of Kodak and Nokia, showcasing how innovation can lead to the obsolescence of once-dominant firms.
