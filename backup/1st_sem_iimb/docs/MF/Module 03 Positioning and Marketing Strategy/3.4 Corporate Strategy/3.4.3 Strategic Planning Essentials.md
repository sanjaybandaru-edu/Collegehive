# 3.4.3 Strategic Planning Essentials

## Overview
Strategic planning for Strategic Business Units (SBUs), such as a specific brand (e.g., Lifebuoy or Lux), involves defining the mission, analyzing internal and external factors, setting objectives, formulating strategies, implementing programs, and monitoring outcomes. This process aligns with corporate strategic planning.

## Strategic Planning Process for SBUs

1. **Mission or Purpose**
   - The foundation of strategic planning.
   - Defines the reason or purpose for which the organization or brand exists.

### Key Questions for Mission (Peter Drucker):
   1. What is your business?
   2. Who is the customer?
   3. What is value to the customer?
   4. What will our business be in the future?
   5. What should our business be?

   **Example**:  
   - For Lifebuoy: "To provide affordable hygiene solutions to improve global health."
   - For Lux: "To offer luxurious personal care products for women to feel confident and beautiful."

   - **Internal Analysis**: Strengths and weaknesses within the organization.

   **Tool**: SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).  
   - **Strengths**: Internal capabilities (e.g., strong brand recognition, superior R&D).  
   - **Weaknesses**: Internal limitations (e.g., limited distribution network).  
   - **Opportunities**: External factors (e.g., untapped markets, changing consumer trends).  
   - **Threats**: External risks (e.g., competition, regulatory challenges).

4. **Strategy Development**

5. **Program Formulation and Implementation**

6. **Feedback and Control**
   - Monitor and evaluate performance against objectives.
   - Use benchmarks (e.g., monthly sales targets) to track progress.
   - Adjust strategies based on performance:
     - Example: If sales targets fall short, increase promotions or reassess pricing.
