# 3.3.1 Beyond STP: Evaluating Market Size for Effective Marketing Strategy Development

## Key Concepts in Market Size Analysis

### 1. **Potential Market**
- Definition: The set of all consumers who show **interest** in a product or service.
- Factors not considered:
  - Income or financial capability.
  - Accessibility to the product or service.

### 2. **Available Market**
- Definition: Subset of the potential market comprising consumers who:
  1. Have **interest** in the product.
  2. Possess the **income** to purchase it.
  3. Have **access** to the market (e.g., distribution network availability).
- Example:
  - A product available only in the U.S. limits access to consumers in other regions.

### 3. **Target Market**
- Definition: Subset of the available market that the company actively pursues through marketing activities.
- Factors Influencing Target Market:
  - Resource constraints (e.g., online-only strategy vs. physical store distribution).
  - Marketing strategy (e.g., focus on age group 15–25 for online platforms).
- Example:
  - A company may target only the **50–60 age group** if its product is sold primarily through local stores (kirana shops).

## Market Demand, Forecast, and Primary & Secondary Demand

### 1. **Market Demand**
- Definition: Total volume that will be purchased by a specific customer group over a specific time, in a specific environment, and under a specific marketing program.
- **Marketing Program**: Combination of the **4Ps** (Product, Price, Place, Promotion).
- **Dependence on Marketing Expenditure**:
  - Market demand is proportional to resources and efforts allocated to marketing.

### 2. **Market Forecast**
- Definition: Market demand at a specific level of marketing expenditure.
- **Dynamic Nature**:
  - Increasing expenditure can increase the market forecast by reaching more customers.
  - Decreasing expenditure reduces the market forecast.
- Example:
  - ₹10 crore expenditure might allow access to 3 cities; ₹20 crore could expand access to 10 cities.

### 3. **Primary and Secondary Demand**
- **Primary Demand**:
  - Total volume of demand for a product category (e.g., soap).
- **Secondary Demand**:
  - Demand for a specific brand within that category (e.g., Lux or Lifebuoy).

## Market Expenditure and Demand Curve

- **Market Minimum**:
  - Level of demand without any marketing effort or expenditure.
- **Market Potential**:
  - Maximum achievable demand even with unlimited resources.
- **Market Forecast**:
  - Demand between market minimum and market potential, dependent on marketing expenditure.

### Curve Dynamics
- Increasing expenditure raises demand, but only up to the **market potential**.
- Beyond market potential, additional expenditure has no effect on demand.

## Steps in Market Size Analysis

1. **Determine Potential Market**:
   - Identify consumers with interest in the product.

2. **Assess Available Market**:
   - Filter consumers with interest, income, and accessibility.

3. **Define Target Market**:
   - Narrow down the available market based on:
     - Resource constraints.
     - Marketing strategy and delivery channels.

4. **Estimate Market Demand**:
   - Calculate total potential volume that can be sold in a given environment with a specific marketing program.

5. **Create Market Forecast**:
   - Predict demand at different levels of marketing expenditure.

6. **Distinguish Primary and Secondary Demand**:
   - Differentiate between category-wide demand and brand-specific demand.
