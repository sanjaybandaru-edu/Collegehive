  - **Rohan Kapoor (Son, 21)**: First-year degree student, socio-economic classification A.
  - **Arati Kapoor (Daughter, 18)**: First-year junior college student, socio-economic classification A.

  - **Arun Kapoor**: Risk-averse, organized, cost-conscious, brand-loyal.
  - **Alka Kapoor**: Rational, cost-conscious, passive in the decision-making process.
  - **Rohan Kapoor**: Extroverted, innovative, image-conscious, persuasive.

This will help identify which family member values which aspects of the car the most and whether their preferences align or differ.
