# 4.1.2 Delving Deeper into Consumer Behaviour: Understanding the Definition

## Definition of Consumer Behavior
Consumer behavior is the study of **buying units** and the **exchange process** involved in evaluating, acquiring, consuming, and disposing of goods, services, and ideas. 

While the definition may seem complex, let’s break it down into simpler components for better understanding.

## Key Components of Consumer Behavior

### 1. **Buying Units**
Buying units refer to the individuals or groups involved in the purchasing process.  
Examples:
- **Individuals**: A person buying a shirt for themselves.
- **Groups**: 
  - A family purchasing clothes for a wedding.
  - A group of friends shopping together for similar items.

### 2. **Exchange Process**
The exchange process involves interactions between buyers and sellers, where both parties have the freedom to choose.  
Types of exchanges include:
- **Organization to Consumer (B2C)**: Example - Procter & Gamble selling toothpaste to you.
- **Organization to Organization (B2B)**: Example - A company buying raw materials from a supplier.
- **Consumer to Consumer (C2C)**: Example - Selling products through social media or live-streaming platforms.

In the context of this discussion, the focus is on **organization to consumer (B2C)** exchanges.

## Activities in Consumer Behavior

The study of consumer behavior examines four key activities:

### 1. **Evaluating**
How consumers compare different options before making a purchase.  
Example: Choosing a toothpaste brand.
- Factors considered:
  - Price
  - Size
  - Taste
  - Color
  - Brand reputation
  - Availability (supermarket, online platforms, local stores).

### 2. **Acquiring**
Where and how consumers purchase goods.  
Examples:
- Physical stores: Kirana shops, supermarkets.
- Online platforms: Amazon, Flipkart, BigBasket.
- Quick commerce: Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart.

### 3. **Consuming**
How consumers use the product after purchase.  
Example: Toothpaste usage.
- Brushing habits:
  - Once in the morning.
  - Twice a day (morning and night).
  - Three times a day.

### 4. **Disposing**
What consumers do with the product after use.  
Examples:
- Squeezing the last bit out of a toothpaste tube before disposing of it.
- Disposing of products before they are fully used.

## Why Understanding These Activities is Important

### Case Study: Pepsodent Toothpaste
In the 1990s, Pepsodent introduced a unique marketing proposition:
- Message: Germs return to teeth after eating, so you should brush twice a day (morning and night).
  
Impact:
- Previously, families used one toothpaste tube per month.
- By encouraging brushing twice a day, consumption doubled to two tubes per month.
- Result: 
  - Sales increased from 50,000 tubes to 1,00,000 tubes per month.
  - Market size and usage rate expanded without increasing the customer base.

This highlights how **consumer behavior—especially consumption patterns—influences marketing strategy, market size, and market share.**

## Implications for Marketing Strategy

### Influence on Marketing
Understanding consumer behavior allows businesses to:
1. Identify factors that influence purchasing decisions.
2. Create strategies to optimize product usage.
3. Tailor marketing efforts to match consumer preferences.

### Broader Impact
Consumer behavior not only determines how consumers interact with products but also shapes:
- Product design.
- Distribution strategies.
- Marketing messages.
