## Illustrating Consumer Behavior Through Purchasing Patterns

Let’s examine how price-conscious consumers may behave when buying a TV.

### Four Consumer Archetypes Based on Price Sensitivity
1. **Price Limit-Oriented**:
   - Sets a strict budget (e.g., under ₹50,000).
   - Considers only TVs within this budget.

2. **Filtered Quality-Oriented**:
   - Considers multiple factors (brand, quality, store reputation).
   - Narrows down options and then chooses the lowest-priced TV.

3. **Store Loyalty-Oriented**:
   - Always shops at a specific store (e.g., Croma).
   - Buys the TV with the best discount in that store.

4. **Sale Event-Oriented**:
   - Waits for major sales (e.g., Amazon’s Independence Day sale).
   - Buys the lowest-priced TV during the event.

### Insight
- All four are price-conscious but approach purchasing differently.
- This highlights the diversity in consumer behavior even within a single target group.

## Broader Scope of Consumer Behavior
Marketing borrows concepts from disciplines like:
- **Psychology**: Understanding individual behavior.
- **Sociology**: Understanding group dynamics.

---

## Types of Consumers
### Focus: **Individual or Personal Consumers**
- Purchase for personal use (e.g., toothpaste, cooking oil).
  
### Other Types of Consumers
1. **Organizational Consumers**:
   - Entities like hotels, schools, hospitals, or jails purchasing for operational purposes.
   
2. **Industrial Consumers**:
   - Businesses buying raw materials to produce final products (e.g., oil for soap manufacturing).
