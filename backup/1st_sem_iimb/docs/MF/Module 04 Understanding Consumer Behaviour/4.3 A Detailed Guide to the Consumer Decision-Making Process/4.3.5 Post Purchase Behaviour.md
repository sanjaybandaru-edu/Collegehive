# 4.3.5 Post Purchase Behaviour

## Importance of Post-Purchase Behavior

### The Airbnb Example
Airbnb’s business model is a prime example of the importance of post-purchase behavior:
1. **Customer Feedback**: After a stay, customers provide feedback on the property. This feedback directly influences future customers’ decisions.
2. **Host Feedback**: Hosts also review guests, creating a two-way accountability system that emphasizes post-purchase evaluation.
3. **Impact on Business**: Positive reviews build trust and attract more users, while negative feedback serves as a warning, ensuring transparency for all parties.

This highlights how post-purchase behavior can shape a business's success by influencing future purchase decisions.

## Theoretical Framework of Post-Purchase Behavior

Post-purchase satisfaction or dissatisfaction arises when a product or service's **performance** meets, exceeds, or falls short of customer **expectations**. This is summarized in three scenarios:

1. **Satisfaction**: When performance matches expectations.
2. **Dissatisfaction**: When performance is below expectations, leading to cognitive dissonance.
3. **Delight**: When performance exceeds expectations.

### Managing Expectations for Delight
To achieve customer delight, expectations must be carefully managed. However, this requires a balance:
- **Under-promising**: Leads to low expectations, making it easier to exceed them. However, it may fail to attract customers in the first place.
- **Over-promising**: Attracts customers with high expectations but risks dissatisfaction if promises are not met.

The ideal approach lies in setting realistic expectations while delivering exceptional performance.

### Example: Restaurants
- **Five-Star Restaurants**: Customers accept long waiting times (e.g., 45 minutes to an hour) because the ambience and premium service set the expectation of a relaxed, high-quality dining experience.
- **Fast Food Outlets**: A delay of even five minutes can lead to frustration because the expectation is quick service.

These scenarios highlight the importance of setting appropriate expectations to avoid dissatisfaction.

## Strategies for Effective Post-Purchase Management

### 1. **Customer Engagement**
   - Utilize social media, personalized emails, or phone calls to stay connected with customers.
   - Demonstrate care and concern for their experience.

### 2. **Expectation Management**
   - Clearly communicate what the product or service offers during the pre-purchase stage.
   - Ensure alignment between promotional messages and actual delivery.

### 3. **Testimonials and Social Proof**
   - Showcase positive feedback from satisfied customers to reassure potential buyers.
   - Highlight examples of how others have successfully used and benefited from the product.

### 4. **Handling High-Involvement Purchases**
   - Products like cars, TVs, or washing machines demand more attention to post-purchase behavior due to their high cost and long-term usage.
   - Offer comprehensive after-sales support and warranty services.
