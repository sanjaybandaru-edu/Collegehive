## Criteria for Selecting a Target Segment
There are three major parameters or blocks of criteria for selecting a target market:

### 1. **Segment Size and Growth**
   - **Size**: 
     - What is the current size of the market?
     - A larger market size is typically preferred for profitability.
   - **Growth**: 
     - Consider the future potential of the market.
     - Avoid markets with limited or short-term growth prospects.

### 2. **Market Attractiveness**
   - Assess how attractive the market is based on its structure:
     - **Competitive Landscape**: Is there too much competition? Highly competitive markets may be less attractive despite their size.
     - **Barriers to Entry**: Are there barriers that can limit your ability to operate or grow in the segment?

### 3. **Organizational Objectives and Resources**
   - **Objectives**:
     - What is the organization aiming for? Examples include:
       - Growth
       - Market share
       - Revenue
       - Profit
       - Customer satisfaction
   - **Resources**:
     - Does the organization have the necessary resources to achieve its objectives in the chosen segment? Examples include:
       - Manpower
       - Financial power
       - Technology solutions
   - Alignment: Even if a market is large and attractive, it is not viable if the organization's resources are insufficient to capture and serve the market effectively.
