## Purpose of Segmentation

## Segmentation Process
1. **Identify the Market**:
   - Start with a heterogeneous market (e.g., a city like Bangalore).
2. **Choose a Basis for Segmentation**:
   - Divide the market into smaller groups based on specific characteristics.
   - Example: Age group of 30–40 years in Bangalore.
3. **Create Homogeneous Groups**:
   - Focus on subsets of customers with shared needs or characteristics.
   - Ensure the groups are distinct from each other.

- **Behavioral**: Usage patterns, loyalty, purchase frequency.
