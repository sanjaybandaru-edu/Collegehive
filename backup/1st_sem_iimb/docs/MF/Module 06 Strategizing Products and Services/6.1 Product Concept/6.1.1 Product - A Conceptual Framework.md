## **The Five Levels of a Product**
A product provides value to customers across five levels, each adding layers of satisfaction and differentiation. These levels are:

1. **Core Benefit**
2. **Basic Product**
3. **Expected Product**
4. **Augmented Product**
5. **Potential Product**

### **1. Core Benefit**
- **Definition:** The fundamental service or benefit that the customer is truly buying.
- **Example:** In the case of a hotel stay, the core benefit is **rest and sleep**.
- The customer chooses a hotel because they need a place to sleep and rest while traveling, not just to book a room.

### **2. Basic Product**
- **Definition:** The basic physical and tangible elements that deliver the core benefit to the consumer.
- **Example:** In a hotel, the core benefit (rest and sleep) is delivered through:
  - A **room**
  - A **bed**
  - A **bathroom**
  - A **desk** and **closet**
- These elements are necessary to fulfill the core benefit but are often insufficient by themselves.

### **3. Expected Product**
- **Definition:** A set of attributes or conditions that customers expect to be provided along with the product. Without these, they will be dissatisfied.
- **Example:** In a hotel:
  - Clean bed, pillow, and mattress
  - Fresh towels
  - Soap and toiletries
  - A table lamp or fan
- **Why itâ€™s expected:** Competitors typically provide these attributes, making them the standard. If these are not included, customers will likely choose another provider.

### **4. Augmented Product**
- **Definition:** Features or attributes that exceed customer expectations, providing a unique selling proposition (USP) and differentiation.
- **Example:** In a hotel:
  - An air-conditioned room (when others only provide fans)
  - A TV with cable channels
  - A mini-fridge, sofa set, or premium toiletries
- Augmented features make the customer happier by offering something additional.

### **5. Potential Product**
- **Definition:** All possible future augmentations or transformations that a product may undergo to delight customers and create new value.
- **Example:** For a hotel:
  - Smart TVs with OTT subscriptions
  - Business-friendly features like video conferencing
  - Advanced IoT integration, such as smart lighting or voice assistants

## **Positioning: Point of Parity (POP) vs. Point of Difference (POD)**
The product levels align closely with **positioning strategies**:
- **Point of Parity (POP):** Attributes that are expected because all competitors offer them. These form the **expected product**.
- **Point of Difference (POD):** Features that exceed customer expectations, making the product stand out. These align with the **augmented product**.

## **Understanding Through Examples**
1. **Hotel Scenario:**
   - **Core Benefit:** Rest and sleep.
   - **Basic Product:** Room, bed, bathroom.
   - **Expected Product:** Clean sheets, fresh towels, basic toiletries.
   - **Augmented Product:** Smart TVs, luxury toiletries, mini-bars.
   - **Potential Product:** AI-driven room personalization, VR entertainment systems.

2. **Customer-Specific Needs:**
   - **Honeymoon Package:** Focus on luxurious experiences and privacy.
   - **Religious Tourism:** Basic amenities and proximity to pilgrimage sites.
   - **Adventure Tourism:** Safety supplies and rugged facilities.

## **Adapting to the Market**
The differentiation of a product depends on:
1. **Customer Needs:** What the target customer values most.
2. **Competitor Offerings:** What competitors are providing as expected or augmented features.
3. **Market Context:** The type of market and its unique challenges or demands.

By continuously revisiting these factors, businesses can rediscover new opportunities to provide value and create sustainable differentiation.
