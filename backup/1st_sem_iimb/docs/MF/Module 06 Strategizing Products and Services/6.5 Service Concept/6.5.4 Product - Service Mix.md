# 6.5.4 Product - Service Mix

Just like the **marketing mix**, which involves the combination of product, price, place, and promotion, the **service mix** is a concept that focuses on the various components of a service offering. The service mix refers to the range of service elements that a company combines to satisfy customer needs and enhance their overall experience. It includes five different types of offerings, each representing a distinct combination of **product** and **service** elements.

## Five Types of Offerings in the Service Mix

### 1. **Pure Tangible Good**

At one end of the service mix continuum, we have **pure tangible goods**. These are products that have no significant service component accompanying them. Examples include routine purchases like **rice, pulses, toothpaste, soap**, and other **FMCG products**. These items are sold and consumed with little to no additional service involvement.

However, as markets evolve, even pure tangible goods are increasingly paired with service components. For example:
- In large format retail stores, **displays**, **point-of-sale arrangements**, and **visual merchandising** play a significant role.
- When these products are available **online**, **filters** (brand, price, customer feedback) and other services like **delivery options** become part of the offering.

Thus, while the core of a **pure tangible good** offering has no service, businesses increasingly find ways to integrate service elements to enhance the customer experience.

### 2. **Tangible Good with Accompanying Service**

Next on the continuum, we have **tangible goods with accompanying service**. Here, products are the primary focus, but they come with essential service components. These offerings typically involve **technologically sophisticated products** such as cars, **white goods** (washing machines, refrigerators), and **computers**.

In this case, the service components might include:
- **Display rooms** for product viewing.
- **Delivery** and **installation** services.
- **Repair** and **maintenance** services.
- **Warranty** and **training** on product usage.

For example, a car cannot be easily purchased without the service of having a nearby **service center** or **spare parts availability**. Without these services, sales would likely decline. This highlights how the service component plays a critical role in the customerâ€™s decision-making process.

### 3. **Hybrid Offering**

The **hybrid offering** strikes a balance, giving equal importance to both the product and service components. A classic example is a **restaurant**, where the **food** is the primary product, but the **ambience**, **service quality**, and **personalized experience** are equally important.

In such a hybrid offering, both the tangible product (food) and the service elements (staff interaction, ambiance, etc.) contribute to the overall customer experience. Both are essential for delivering value, and a deficiency in one can significantly affect the perceived quality of the offering.

### 4. **Service Major with Accompanying Goods**

On the other side of the continuum, there are offerings where **service is the major component** and the **goods** or physical products are secondary. Examples include **airlines**, **rail travel**, and **insurance policies**.

- **Airlines**: The core offering is the **transportation service**, but the service may also include complementary goods such as **refreshments**, the **ambience** of the flight, or even the **hygiene of restrooms**.
  
- **Insurance**: The core service is the **coverage** provided by the policy, but the **paperwork** associated with it becomes a minor product aspect. The convenience of a **paperless process** is often a key factor in customer preference.

Here, the **service** is dominant, and the **goods** or physical products (like tickets or insurance documents) serve as minor supporting elements. The overall customer experience is heavily influenced by the quality of the service rather than the product.

### 5. **Pure Service**

At the extreme end of the continuum, we have **pure services**, where **no significant product** is involved. These are offerings where the **service** is the core value, and there is little to no physical product. Examples include:
- **Consulting** services
- **Clinical psychology**
- **Babysitting**
- **Massage therapies**

In these cases, the service is completely intangible. There is no ownership of a physical product; customers pay for the experience or expertise provided by the service. The focus is entirely on the delivery of the service itself, with little to no tangible component involved.
