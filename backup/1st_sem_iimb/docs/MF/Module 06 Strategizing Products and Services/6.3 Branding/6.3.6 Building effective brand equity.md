# 6.3.6 Building effective brand equity

Brand equity refers to the set of assets linked to a brand's name that adds value to its products or services.

## Components of Brand Equity (David Aaker's Model)

David Aaker's framework identifies key elements that constitute brand equity:

1. **Brand Awareness**  
   - The simplest form of brand equity.  
   - It reflects the familiarity of consumers with the brand.  
   - A well-known brand creates a sense of trust and preference.

2. **Perceived Quality**  
   - A recognized brand often conveys a perception of quality.  
   - Consumers know what to expect from the brand, increasing reliability and trust.

3. **Brand Associations**  
   - Subjective and emotional associations linked to the brand.  
   - These include attributes like personality and lifestyle connections.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Saffola: Associated with a healthy heart.  
     - Dove: Linked to beauty and moisturizing benefits.  
     - Harley-Davidson: Represents a macho, rebellious lifestyle.  
     - Pepsi: Reflects youthfulness and rebellion.  

4. **Brand Loyalty**  
   - The strongest measure of brand equity.  
   - Loyal customers endorse and advocate for the brand, contributing to its growth and market share.  

5. **Other Brand Assets**  
   - **Patents, trademarks, and proprietary technology** act as barriers to entry, protecting the brand’s market position.

## Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) Model

The Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) model explores the consumer’s perspective of brand equity. It revolves around four steps (or questions), structured as a pyramid:

### **Step 1: Brand Identity**  
- **Question**: *Who are you?*  
- The brand creates identification and association.  
- **Example**: Apple answers, "I am innovative and stylish."

### **Step 2: Brand Meaning**  
- **Question**: *What are you?*  
- The brand establishes its meaning in the consumer’s mind through its attributes and benefits.  
- **Example**: Apple answers, "I am premium, easy to use, and a status symbol."

### **Step 3: Brand Response**  
- **Question**: *What do I think or feel about you?*  
- The consumer reflects on their experiences and perceptions of the brand.  
- **Example**: With Apple, the consumer might think, "I feel technology, innovation, and great design."

### **Step 4: Brand Resonance**  
- **Question**: *What kind of relationship or connection would I like to have with you?*  
- The consumer decides their level of loyalty and connection to the brand.  
- **Example**: With Apple, they see the brand as a problem-solver, a leader, and a community builder.
