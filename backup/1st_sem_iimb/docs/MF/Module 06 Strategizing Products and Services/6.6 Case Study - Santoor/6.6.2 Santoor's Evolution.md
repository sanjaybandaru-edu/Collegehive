## Santoor's Entry into the Soap Market

Santoor, introduced by **Wipro** in 1985, aimed to enter the **popular soap segment**, which represented 40% of the market. The company wanted to target the segment with a unique proposition based on sandalwood and turmeric. The name "Santoor" is derived from these ingredients, where **San** stands for sandalwood, and **Tur** comes from turmeric.

### Initial Success
- **Test Marketing**: Santoor was first tested in Bangalore, and the results were encouraging.
- **Launch**: Santoor was officially launched in 1985 and quickly gained momentum, reaching 1,500 tons per annum with a 1.5% market share.
- **Pricing Strategy**: Santoor was attractively priced, and due to its unique ingredients, it positioned itself as a quality product in a competitive market.

### Price Increase and its Impact
In the late 1980s, due to rising costs of vegetable oil, packaging, and excise duties, the price of Santoor had to increase. This price hike affected the brand more significantly compared to established brands like **Lifebuoy**, **Lux**, **Palmolive**, and others.

#### Why Santoor Was More Affected by the Price Hike:
Santoor was a relatively new brand with no significant **brand loyalty** or **trust** among consumers at the time. Without a **unique selling proposition (USP)**, consumers often purchased Santoor out of **innovative behavior** or **boredom** with their regular soap brands. When the price increased, there was no emotional attachment to the brand, and consumers easily switched to other brands, which had already established loyalty.

### Stabilization and Marketing Campaigns (1988-89)
By 1988, after initial challenges, Santoor stabilized its volume at **2,400 tons per annum**. However, there was **no real growth** in the brand during this period. Consumers were switching brands, and trial rates were declining. To address this, Wipro launched two major **advertising campaigns**.

## Santoor's Advertising Campaigns

Santoor launched **two advertising campaigns** during this period as part of its **positioning strategy**. These campaigns focused on the following:

1. **Target Segment**: 
   - The primary target was the **middle-income segment**, which formed a large part of the **popular soap category** (40% of the market).
   
2. **Value Proposition**: 
   - The key value proposition was **value for money** and **beauty care** through the natural benefits of sandalwood and turmeric. 
   - These ingredients were positioned as not just traditional but as offering **health benefits**, which set Santoor apart in a crowded soap market.

The **advertising campaigns** sought to create an emotional connection with consumers by highlighting the soap’s natural ingredients and the feeling of freshness and care. Santoor positioned itself as a **beauty care** soap that also provided health benefits, offering both affordability and quality.

## Campaign Overview
During the stability phase, **Santoor Soap** ran two prominent campaigns: one in **Hindi** and another in **English**. These campaigns focused on a **traditional Indian woman** as the target segment. The woman depicted in these ads was shown as **conventional**—often involved in **household activities**, performing **puja** (prayers), and dressed traditionally. This representation suggests she values tradition and uses traditional ingredients like **sandalwood (chandan)** and **turmeric** for beauty and skincare. The campaign highlighted **sandalwood** for its **aroma** and **turmeric** for **healthy skin**. 

### Target Segment
The target segment in these ads was clearly **conventional Indian women**, likely from the **middle-class** segment. These women were depicted as caring about traditional beauty practices and using **sandalwood** and **turmeric**—ingredients that are considered tried and tested for their beauty benefits. The ads resonated with an audience that values **heritage**, **natural ingredients**, and the **traditional wisdom** passed down through generations.

However, despite this focus, there was a noticeable gap in the brand’s ability to drive significant growth. **Santoor’s** volume remained stagnant, and its **top-of-mind awareness** was low. Despite communicating the benefits of sandalwood and turmeric, the brand was not able to generate strong consumer interest or differentiation.

## Problem Identification
By the mid-1990s, **Santoor** faced several challenges:

- **Top-of-mind awareness (TOMA)** for **Santoor** was as low as **0.8%**, and the brand aimed to increase this to **4.5%**.
- The product was **perceived as conventional** and **lacked aspirational value**.
- Despite emphasizing its ingredients (sandalwood and turmeric), there was **low correlation** between the brand name and its ingredients in the minds of consumers.
- The brand’s ambassador and overall communication failed to connect emotionally with the target audience.
- **Santoor** was becoming a **niche product** for consumers obsessed with sandalwood, but it struggled to appeal to the broader market.

### Consumer Insights
To understand the reasons behind the brand's stagnation, **FCB Ulka** conducted **consumer research**, revealing the following insights:

1. **Ingredient Story**: Despite repeated emphasis on **sandalwood** and **turmeric**, the story did not resonate with the broader target group. Many consumers did not notice or connect the ingredients to the soap’s benefits.
2. **Middle-Class Image**: Santoor was perceived as a **middle-class brand**, and its image lacked any **aspirational** qualities. The brand failed to communicate a strong benefit to differentiate itself in the market.
3. **Niche Market**: Santoor had found a **niche** with those who were specifically interested in **sandalwood**, but this limited its growth potential in the broader soap market.

### Psychographic Analysis
The **psychographic** analysis revealed a significant shift in consumer attitudes in the mid-90s:

- **Women** increasingly wanted to be **admired** and **loved**. Beauty and good looks became desirable attributes.
- There was a growing focus on **self-image** and **personal care**. People were paying more attention to how they dressed and presented themselves, rather than just adhering to traditional roles like being a homemaker.
- **Urbanization**, **disposable income**, and the desire for **modern lifestyles** led to a greater emphasis on **self-care** and beauty, with many women seeking products that made them feel good about themselves.

In this evolving context, **Santoor**, which had a **traditional middle-class** appeal, was struggling to connect with the **modern, aspirational** woman. The brand needed to evolve its positioning to resonate with the changing consumer values.

## The Repositioning Strategy
To address these issues, **FCB Ulka** proposed a **repositioning strategy** to **differentiate** Santoor in the market. The primary goal was to **retain existing customers** while attracting new ones, with the ultimate target of increasing market share.

### Key Strategic Insights:
1. **Differentiation through Ingredients**:  
   The traditional ingredients of **sandalwood** and **turmeric** would remain at the core of the brand’s story. However, instead of focusing solely on **skin care**, the new positioning would emphasize **younger-looking skin**—a more **aspirational** benefit for consumers. 

2. **Focus on Youthful Skin**:  
   The USP of Santoor would shift from simply being **good for the skin** to offering **younger-looking skin**. The idea was to position Santoor as a soap that not only cares for the skin but also helps maintain a **youthful, radiant appearance**.

3. **Experiential and Social Value**:  
   By focusing on the idea of **youthful skin**, the brand aimed to shift its value proposition from **functional benefits** (like fragrance and skin care) to **experiential and social benefits**. The new message was that Santoor would make users feel younger, and others would notice and admire their youthful appearance.

4. **Modern and Aspirational Outlook**:  
   **Santoor** needed to break free from its **middle-class image** and appeal to a more **modern, urban** audience. The brand would no longer be limited to traditional women; instead, it would aim to connect with women who cared about **beauty**, **self-care**, and **personal empowerment**.

### The New Positioning
The repositioned Santoor soap would stand for **youthful, glowing skin**, leveraging the established benefits of **sandalwood** and **turmeric** while addressing the evolving aspirations of modern Indian women. The goal was to create an emotional connection with the consumer, focusing on how using Santoor would make them feel **younger** and how others would notice their **radiant skin**.
