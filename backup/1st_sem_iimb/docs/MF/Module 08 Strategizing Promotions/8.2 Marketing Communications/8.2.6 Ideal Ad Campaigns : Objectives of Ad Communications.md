# 8.2.6 Ideal Ad Campaigns : Objectives of Ad Communications

Communication objectives are crucial in guiding the direction of an advertising campaign. These objectives help in defining the purpose of the campaign and its impact on the consumer. Below are some common communication objectives:

---

## 1. **Category Needs**
### Objective: Create a Need for the Product or Service Category
This objective focuses on establishing the need for a specific product or service category, not a particular brand. It highlights a **perceived discrepancy** between a consumer's current state and their desired state. This type of campaign aims to create a desire for the entire category.

- **Example: Milk Campaign**  
  In a milk campaign, the focus is not on any specific brand (e.g., Amul, Nandini, etc.), but rather on promoting **milk as a category**. The objective is to make people want to drink milk, regardless of the brand. This can be done by emphasizing different reasons for drinking milk, such as health benefits, fitness, or energy.  
  - Some might drink milk for health.
  - Some for religious reasons.
  - Some for fitness or energy, especially athletes or dancers.  
  The ultimate goal is to create a preference for milk as a drink, making it a popular and desirable option, especially during occasions where people typically wouldnâ€™t choose it (e.g., a hot summer day or a party).

### Key Goal: Increase demand for the product category.

## 2. **Brand Awareness**
### Objective: Increase Consumer's Ability to Recognize or Recall a Brand
Brand awareness is about making consumers aware of a specific brand within a product category. This objective aims to ensure that consumers can recognize or recall a brand when considering a purchase.

- **Example: Amul Milk Campaign**  
  In this case, the campaign transitions from promoting milk as a category to promoting **Amul milk** specifically. The focus is on increasing awareness of the Amul brand within the milk category. Consumers should now be able to recall Amul when they think of milk, which is crucial for influencing their purchasing decision.

### Key Goal: Build recognition or recall of a specific brand within its category.

## 3. **Brand Attitude**
### Objective: Develop a Positive Perception of the Brand
Brand attitude refers to shaping a consumer's overall perception and feelings about a brand. This objective helps consumers evaluate a brand in relation to their needs and motivates them to consider it favorably.

- **Example: Pepsodent Campaign**  
  Pepsodent's campaign focuses on promoting the benefits of their toothpaste by addressing the common concern of **oral hygiene**. The ad humorously showcases how Pepsodent helps eliminate germs that can cause tooth decay after consuming sugary foods, like ice cream. The campaign aims to create a **positive attitude** toward the Pepsodent brand, showing consumers that it is the best solution to their oral hygiene needs.

### Key Goal: Develop a positive attitude and perception of the brand by highlighting how it meets a relevant consumer need.

## 4. **Purchase Intention**
### Objective: Drive Consumers to Make a Purchase or Take Purchase-Related Actions
The purchase intention objective focuses on encouraging consumers to decide to purchase the brand or take actions leading to a purchase.

- **Example: Amazon Great Indian Festival Campaign**  
  The objective of this campaign is to **motivate immediate purchases**. The campaign highlights **limited-time offers** during the Amazon Great Indian Festival, showcasing various products at discounted prices. It presents various scenarios where the products can be used (e.g., for Diwali celebrations, sports events, or family gatherings). The goal is to create a sense of urgency and push consumers to act during the festival period.

### Key Goal: Drive consumers to take action and make a purchase, usually within a limited time frame.
