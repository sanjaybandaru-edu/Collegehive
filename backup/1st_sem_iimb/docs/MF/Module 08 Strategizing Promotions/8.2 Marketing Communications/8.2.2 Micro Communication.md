# 8.2.2 Micro Communication

The micro model of communication focuses on understanding the **consumer's reaction to marketing communication**. It examines how a consumer progresses from awareness to purchase and beyond. Various models explain this response, helping marketers tailor their strategies based on consumer behavior.

## **Generalized Consumer Response Model**

### **Stages of Consumer Response**:
1. **Awareness**: The consumer becomes aware of the product.
2. **Knowledge**: The consumer gathers information about the product (e.g., features, benefits).
3. **Liking**: A positive attitude or emotional connection forms.
4. **Preference**: The consumer begins favoring the product over alternatives.
5. **Conviction**: The consumer develops a strong belief in the product's value.
6. **Purchase**: The consumer takes action to buy the product.

### **Purpose of Marketing Communication**:
- To guide the consumer through one or more stages of this journey.
- To align the communication strategy with the desired outcome, whether it is awareness, preference, or purchase.

**Key Insight**: An enjoyable advertisement is not always a successful one. Success depends on whether the communication achieves its intended purpose.

## **Response Sequences**

Different products and consumer involvement levels lead to varying sequences of response:

### 1. **Learn, Feel, Do**:
- **Explanation**: Consumers first learn about the product, develop an emotional connection, and then take action to purchase.
- **Applicability**: High-involvement products with significant differentiation (e.g., automobiles).
- **Example**: A car buyer researches, feels emotionally connected during a test drive, and then decides to buy.

### 2. **Do, Feel, Learn**:
- **Explanation**: Consumers act first, then form opinions and learn about the product later.
- **Applicability**: Low-involvement products or products with limited differentiation (e.g., chewing gum).
- **Example**: A customer buys Center Fresh gum, enjoys its taste, and learns about the brand post-purchase.

### 3. **Learn, Do, Feel**:
- **Explanation**: Consumers learn about the product, act based on this knowledge, and develop emotional responses later.
- **Applicability**: Low-involvement products with minimal differentiation (e.g., salt or batteries).
- **Example**: A buyer chooses a known battery brand due to prior knowledge and experiences satisfaction after use.

## **Case Studies: Applying Micro Models**

### **1. Center Fresh Gum**:
- **Sequence**: Do, Feel, Learn.
- **Reason**: Consumers likely buy the gum first without extensive research, experience its taste, and then associate with the brand.
- **Objective**: Build liking and preference through enjoyable and memorable campaigns.

### **2. Diabetic Toffee**:
- **Sequence**: Learn, Do, Feel.
- **Reason**: The product caters to a niche audience (diabetics) and has a higher price. Consumers need to understand its benefits before trying it.
- **Objective**: Highlight differentiation (e.g., sugar-free quality), ensure knowledge transfer, and foster trial.

### **3. Godiva Chocolate**:
- **Sequence**: Learn, Feel, Do.
- **Reason**: High-priced luxury chocolates require consumers to understand the brandâ€™s exclusivity, build emotional resonance, and then commit to purchase.
- **Objective**: Emphasize brand prestige and create a sense of indulgence before purchase.

## **Developing Marketing Strategies Based on Micro Models**

1. **Identify Consumer Group**:
   - Determine the target audience and their involvement level.

2. **Understand Product Differentiation**:
   - Assess whether the product stands out in the market.

3. **Select the Appropriate Sequence**:
   - Align communication strategy with the likely consumer response pattern:
     - **Learn, Feel, Do** for high-differentiation, high-involvement products.
     - **Do, Feel, Learn** for low-involvement products.
     - **Learn, Do, Feel** for low-involvement, low-differentiation products.

4. **Design Campaigns Accordingly**:
   - For **awareness**: Use broad-reach media like TV or social platforms.
   - For **preference**: Highlight unique features and benefits.
   - For **purchase**: Offer promotions, discounts, or easy accessibility.

## **Conclusion**

The micro model of communication helps marketers predict and influence consumer behavior by understanding the typical response patterns for different products. Whether promoting a luxury chocolate, a niche toffee, or everyday gum, the success of marketing communication lies in tailoring strategies to align with how consumers learn, feel, and act in relation to the product.
