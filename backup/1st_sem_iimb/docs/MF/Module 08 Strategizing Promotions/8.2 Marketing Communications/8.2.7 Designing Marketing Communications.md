# 8.2.7 Designing Marketing Communications

In designing communication for marketing and advertising, three essential components need to be considered:

1. **Message Strategy** – What to say (Content of the message)
2. **Creative Strategy** – How to say it (The way the message is presented)
3. **Message Source** – Who should say it (The person or entity delivering the message)

## 1. Message Strategy

The message strategy focuses on determining the core themes, ideas, and appeals that will resonate with the target audience. The goal is to align the message with the brand's positioning. 

- **Positioning** is about creating a specific image or perception in the consumer's mind. This can be based on the Product’s Points of Parity (POP) and Points of Difference (POD).
  - **POP**: Attributes that are essential for a product category and must be present in a brand to compete effectively.
  - **POD**: Unique attributes that differentiate the brand from competitors.
  
For example, **Coca-Cola** can either emphasize its **taste** (focusing on product attributes) or its association with **special moments** (positioning it as the beverage for happiness in social gatherings). 

The **rewards** customers expect from a product can be categorized into:
- **Rational Reward**: Logical benefits like cost-effectiveness or performance.
- **Sensory Reward**: Emotional satisfaction, such as comfort or pleasure.
- **Social Reward**: Social approval, belonging, or status.
- **Ego Satisfaction**: The feeling of uniqueness, power, or prestige.

These rewards can be communicated in different ways:
- **Result of Use**: The reward comes directly from using the product (e.g., a bike that helps you reach your destination on time).
- **Product in Use**: The enjoyment or satisfaction derived from using the product (e.g., feeling the thrill of riding the bike).
- **Incidental to Use**: Benefits that arise indirectly from using the product (e.g., getting photographed with the bike in a campaign).

### Examples:
- **Rational Reward**: A detergent that effectively removes stains (e.g., Surf's "Daag Acche Hain" campaign).
- **Sensory Reward**: A chocolate with an excellent taste (e.g., Amul butter or Melody chocolate).
  
## 2. Creative Strategy

The creative strategy outlines how the message will be communicated to the target audience. It can be categorized into **informational** and **transformational** strategies:

### Informational Strategy:
This strategy focuses on delivering logical, factual information about the product’s features, benefits, or comparisons. Examples of informational strategies include:
- **Problem Solution**: “Saridon stops headaches quickly” (solving a problem).
- **Product Demonstration**: Showing how a washing machine can wash clothes.
- **Product Comparison**: Comparing car engine power or fuel efficiency.

### Transformational Strategy:
This strategy seeks to stir emotions, create desire, and establish an image or experience related to the brand. Examples include:
- **Royal Enfield**: Emphasizing adventure and thrill for people seeking excitement.
- **Fiama Di Wills**: Depicting the luxurious feeling of gorgeous skin after using the product.

Transformational strategies also use **positive or negative approaches**. For example, a **negative** strategy might depict the harmful consequences of smoking (e.g., “Smoking reduces weight, one lung at a time”).

### Example:
- **Asian Paints**: Depicts both rational (functional) benefits and emotional associations with key life moments (e.g., weddings and childbirth).

## 3. Message Source

The choice of who delivers the message is crucial. The message can be more effective depending on whether the source is seen as an **expert**, **trustworthy**, or **likable**.

### Types of Sources:
- **Expert**: A credible figure, like a doctor, whose expertise enhances the message’s trustworthiness (e.g., a dentist recommending a toothpaste).
- **Celebrity**: A popular figure whose likability can attract attention but may not be inherently trustworthy when discussing a product they don't use (e.g., an actor promoting hair oil).
- **Common Man**: A relatable figure, such as a housewife or an everyday person, can convey a sense of trustworthiness, even if they are not experts.

### Example:
- **Asian Paints**: A typical Indian family’s emotional journey through key life moments is presented through relatable, non-expert figures (like the daughter or the father), making the brand more approachable and trustworthy.

## Practical Application with Examples

Let’s take a look at some real campaigns and apply the message strategy components:

### 1. **Asian Paints - Interior Campaign**
- **Message**: Asian Paints is associated with the best days of your life (e.g., weddings, childbirth).
- **How**: Through emotional storytelling, showing key life events like a marriage and childbirth.
- **Who**: The story is told through the eyes of the daughter, creating an emotional bond with the audience.

### 2. **Asian Paints - Exterior Campaign**
- **Message**: Asian Paints exterior emulsion is durable, time-proof, and can withstand harsh weather conditions.
- **How**: Through humor, showing how the house stays new while everything else (people, cars, etc.) ages.
- **Who**: A nosy neighbor, observing and commenting on the passage of time and the lasting beauty of the house.

### 3. **Asian Paints - Tractor Emulsion for Middle Class**
- **Message**: Tractor Emulsion provides value for money, offering a luxurious look at an affordable price.
- **How**: Through humor, showing a character who makes smart, intelligent decisions, reflected in his choice of paint.
- **Who**: The protagonist is the person who chooses Tractor Emulsion for their home, portraying him as a smart and sensible individual.

## Conclusion

Designing effective communication requires a clear understanding of:
- **What** to say (message strategy)
- **How** to say it (creative strategy)
- **Who** should say it (message source)

Each brand must tailor its communication approach based on its target audience, the type of product, and the desired brand image. By carefully choosing the right appeals, message tone, and spokesperson, companies can effectively engage consumers and build long-lasting relationships.
