# 8.2.3 Tools and Techniques of Effective Communication

Marketing communication tools are varied, and choosing the right mix depends on the product, target audience, and objectives. This is referred to as the **promotion mix**, which is similar to a **bouquet**—just as the flowers in a bouquet can vary depending on the occasion, the marketing communication tools change depending on the context and goals. These tools include advertising, sales promotion, personal selling, public relations, events, and more.

## **Promotion Mix**

The **promotion mix** is a combination of different promotional tools used to communicate with potential customers. These tools help in reaching out to the target audience, creating awareness, building a preference, or persuading them to make a purchase.

### **Why the Mix Matters**:
- Different situations require different tools, just like how you would select a bouquet based on the occasion. For example, you wouldn't use the same bouquet for a marriage function as you would for a funeral.
- Similarly, in marketing, your choice of tools and techniques will depend on factors like the product type, its stage in the market, and the target customer. For instance, a **clearance sale** requires different tools compared to a campaign focused on **brand superiority** or a **new startup** trying to establish itself.

## **Common Marketing Communication Tools**

### **1. Advertising**

**Definition**: Advertising is a **paid**, **non-personal** presentation of ideas, goods, or services by an **identified sponsor**. It is typically delivered through mass media to reach a broad audience. 

- **Paid**: The company or sponsor invests money to create and deliver the ad.
- **Non-personal**: The message is delivered to a large audience, not specifically targeted to an individual. It can be via TV, radio, print media, or digital platforms.
- **Identified Sponsor**: You know which company or brand is behind the advertisement. 

### **Types of Advertising Media**:
- **Print Media**: Newspapers, magazines, brochures, and posters.
- **Broadcast Media**: Television and radio commercials.
- **Packaging Inserts**: Advertisements included in product packaging.
- **Motion Pictures**: Ads integrated into movies or TV shows (e.g., product placement in a movie).
- **Point of Purchase Displays**: Ads and displays at retail locations that encourage purchase decisions. These can include shelves, counters, or displays that draw attention to products.
- **Billboards and Posters**: Outdoor advertising that targets consumers on the move.
- **Logos**: The company’s logo often acts as a tool for reinforcing the brand’s identity.

**Example**: When you visit a retail store, you might notice a display promoting a product. This **point of purchase** display encourages you to check out a new product and sometimes prompts immediate buying decisions.

Public relations focuses on building and maintaining a positive public image for a company or brand. This can involve:
