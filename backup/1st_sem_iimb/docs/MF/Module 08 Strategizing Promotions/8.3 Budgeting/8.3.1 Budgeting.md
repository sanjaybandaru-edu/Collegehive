# 8.3.1 Budgeting

In this session, we discussed how to develop a communication strategy for promoting a product, including different approaches for budgeting. Let’s break down the key points discussed:

## Budgeting for Promotion

There are several ways to establish a budget for your promotional efforts. While there is no single "right" method, the following are commonly used approaches:

### 1. **Affordable Method**
   - This is the simplest approach where the company allocates whatever funds are left after other expenses toward promotion.
   - **Who uses it?** Startups or businesses with limited resources may adopt this method as it helps keep costs under control.
   - **Drawback**: It is not the ideal approach since it doesn’t strategically plan how much should be spent on promotion, leading to less efficient budgeting.

### 2. **Percentage of Sales**
   - A more common approach where the promotion budget is calculated based on a percentage of sales revenue. For example, if you generate $100,000 in sales, you might allocate 5%, 10%, or 15% to your promotion.
   - **Who uses it?** This is typically used by established firms with more predictable revenue streams. The percentage could vary based on business goals, market conditions, or industry standards.

### 3. **Competitive Parity**
   - In this approach, you base your promotional budget on what your competitors are spending.
   - **Example**: If your competitor spends 10% of their revenue on promotions, you would do the same to remain competitive.
   - **Who uses it?** This is typically used by firms in competitive markets to ensure they don’t fall behind in their marketing efforts.

### 4. **Objective and Task Method**
   - This method is more complex and strategic. It involves setting clear objectives (like gaining market share) and determining the tasks needed to achieve these objectives. The budget is then calculated based on these tasks.
   - **Steps involved**:
     1. **Market Share Goal**: What is the desired market share? 
     2. **Audience Reach**: How many people need to be reached to achieve this goal?
     3. **Trial Rate**: What percentage of those who see the promotion will try the product?
     4. **Gross Rating Points (GRPs)**: The number of impressions needed to influence customers to try the product.

   This method is detailed and involves creating a funnel to calculate the necessary advertising impressions and expected outcomes.

### Example: Cloud Nine Sunburst Energy Drink

Here’s a simple example to explain how the objective and task method works:

- **Objective**: Cloud Nine wants to introduce a new energy drink, "Sunburst," targeting casual athletes. They estimate 50 million potential users in the market.
  - Their target is to reach 8% of this market, i.e., 4 million users.

- **Task**: The company plans to reach 80% of the market (40 million impressions) with their advertising message. Of these, 25% will try the product, which means 10 million potential trials. Of these, 40% (4 million) will become loyal users, which is the company’s ultimate goal.

- **Budget Calculation**:
  - To achieve these numbers, the company will need to buy 3,200 Gross Rating Points (GRPs).
  - Each GRP costs $10,000, so the total budget for the first year of advertising is $32 million.

This method allows companies to align their promotional spending with specific goals and tasks, ensuring that the budget is spent efficiently to reach their objectives.
