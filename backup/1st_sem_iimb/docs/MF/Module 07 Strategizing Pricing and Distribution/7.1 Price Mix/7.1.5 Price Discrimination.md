# 7.1.5 Price Discrimination

## **1. Price Discrimination**
Price discrimination refers to selling the same product to different customers at different prices. The pricing varies based on factors such as customer segment, location, and channel.

### **Types of Price Discrimination**
1. **Customer Segment Pricing**  
   - Different rates for specific age groups (e.g., kids, elders) or genders.  
   - Example: Reduced ticket prices for children and seniors in movie halls.

2. **Product Form Pricing**  
   - Variants of the same product are priced differently, not in proportion to their production cost.  
   - Example:  
     - Mineral water prices at airports are higher compared to convenience stores or railway stations.  
     - Chocolates sold in premium outlets are priced higher than in regular stores.

3. **Channel Pricing**  
   - Pricing differs based on the sales channel.  
   - Example:  
     - Products sold through a companyâ€™s direct channel might have a lower price than those sold via multi-brand outlets.

4. **Location-Based Pricing**  
   - Pricing varies by location.  
   - Example:  
     - Movie tickets or food items are often more expensive in cinemas and airports compared to other locations.

## **2. Product Mix Pricing**
Product mix pricing involves strategies to price products within a line or across complementary items.

### **Types of Product Mix Pricing**
1. **Product Line Pricing**  
   - Pricing different items in a product line to reflect their quality or target customer segment.  
   - Example:  
     - iPhones with varying features and specifications are priced differently.  
     - FMCG brands offer variants like Surf, SurfXL, or SurfXLmatic, each priced according to their features (e.g., top load, front load, liquid, powder).

2. **Optional Feature Pricing**  
   - Base product priced separately, with additional features priced as extras.  
   - Example:  
     - Cars have a base price, with optional features such as leather seats or advanced sound systems costing extra.

3. **Captive Product Pricing**  
   - Base product is priced low, but consumables required for its use are priced higher.  
   - Example:  
     - Gillette razors are inexpensive, but replacement blades are costly.  
     - HP printers are affordable, but cartridges are priced higher.

4. **Two-Part Pricing**  
   - Pricing involves a fixed fee and a variable charge.  
   - Example:  
     - Telephone services include a fixed rental fee plus variable charges based on usage.  
     - Electricity bills often have fixed charges plus charges based on consumption.

5. **Product Bundling Pricing**  
   - Offering discounts for purchasing multiple items together as a bundle.  
   - Example:  
     - Retailers bundle products like shampoo and conditioner or offer discounts on meal combos.
