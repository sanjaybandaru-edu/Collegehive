# 7.1.2 The Language of Pricing

In this discussion, we delve into the critical concepts associated with pricing in marketing. Pricing plays a pivotal role in determining a product's success, balancing the cost of production, perceived value, and market strategy. Below is a breakdown of these concepts with clear explanations.

## **Key Terms in Pricing**

### **1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
- **Definition:** The total cost of manufacturing a product, including raw materials, packaging, and distribution expenses.
- **Example:** 
  - Manufacturing a bottle of Coca-Cola costs ₹1.
  - Adding packaging and distribution, the COGS becomes ₹1.50.
- **Implication:** The product price is typically set higher than the COGS to ensure profitability.

---

### **2. Product Price**
- **Definition:** The price at which the product is sold to the consumer.
- **Relationship to COGS:**
  - Product price is generally set above the COGS to cover manufacturing, distribution, and marketing expenses.
  - Example: A Coca-Cola bottle might be sold at ₹10, far exceeding the COGS of ₹1.50.

---

### **3. Perceived Value**
- **Definition:** The value that consumers believe a product holds based on its benefits, marketing, and brand association.
- **Factors Influencing Perceived Value:**
  - **Marketing Campaigns:** Celebrity endorsements or event associations enhance perceived value. 
    - Example: Coca-Cola campaigns featuring celebrities or festive themes.
  - **Consumer Perspective:** If the consumer perceives the value of a Coca-Cola bottle to be ₹20 but it's priced at ₹10, the consumer feels they are getting a good deal.
- **Consumer Incentive:** Consumers are motivated to purchase a product when the perceived value exceeds the product price.

---

### **4. Balancing Price and Value**
- Consumers will purchase a product if:
  - **Perceived Value > Product Price:** They feel they are getting a good deal.
- Firms must ensure:
  - **Product Price > COGS:** To avoid losses and achieve profitability.

---

## **Exceptions: When COGS > Product Price**
There are cases where the cost of goods sold exceeds the product price, leading to an intentional loss. This strategy is often used by companies to **acquire customers**. Examples include:
- **E-commerce Platforms:** Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra.
- **Quick Commerce:** Big Basket, Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit.
- **Rationale:** These companies often run on discounts or sales, prioritizing customer acquisition over immediate profitability.
- **Long-Term Objective:** Achieve economies of scale and eventually increase prices or reduce costs to become profitable.

## **Concept of True Economic Value (TEV)**

### **Definition:**
The **True Economic Value** is the sum of:
1. The cost of the **next best alternative**.
2. The value of the **performance differential** between the product and the alternative.

### **Example: Air vs. Train Travel**
- Traveling from Bangalore to Delhi:
  - **Next Best Alternative:** Train (lower cost but takes 36–40 hours).
  - **Performance Differential:** Flight takes 2 hours, saving significant time.
- **Assessment:**
  - If time is not a concern (e.g., vacation), the true economic value of the train is higher.
  - If time is critical (e.g., business meeting), the true economic value of the flight is higher.

### **Implication:**
- Marketers use TEV to position their product as saving time, money, or resources compared to alternatives.
- Ideally, the TEV should be **higher than the perceived value** to demonstrate tangible benefits to the customer.

## **Summary of Pricing Concepts**
1. **COGS:** Represents the baseline cost of manufacturing a product.
2. **Product Price:** Should typically be higher than COGS to ensure profitability.
3. **Perceived Value:** Drives consumer purchase decisions when it exceeds the product price.
4. **True Economic Value (TEV):** Highlights the comparative advantage of the product over alternatives.
5. **Strategic Pricing Exceptions:**
   - Some businesses deliberately price below COGS to acquire customers, aiming for long-term profitability through economies of scale.
