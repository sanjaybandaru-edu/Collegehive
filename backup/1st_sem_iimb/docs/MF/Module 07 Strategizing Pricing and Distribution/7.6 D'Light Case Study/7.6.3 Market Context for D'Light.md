## **Context Analysis**

### **1. Brand Trust**
- **Low Trust in New Brands**: Rural India exhibits low trust in new or unfamiliar brands. Trust-building often requires:
  - **Word of Mouth**: Positive experiences shared among the community.
  - **Personal Experiences**: Direct interactions, such as demos and trials.
  - **Time**: Gaining trust takes 2-3 years on average.
- **Resistance to Change**: Rural customers are dogmatic and hesitant to adopt new products unless they perceive immediate and tangible benefits.

### **2. Focus on Tangible Benefits**
- **Preference for Present Needs**: Customers prioritize immediate needs over aspirational or intangible benefits, such as:
  - Current problems: Education, healthcare, and food are more pressing than improved lighting.
  - Long-term gains: Benefits like better study conditions, lower living costs, and increased work hours are harder to grasp initially.
- **Economic Considerations**: Though kerosene costs â‚¹250 per month, the upfront cost of solar lamps is a significant deterrent. Savings from solar lighting are not immediately evident to customers, making adoption challenging.

### **3. Competition Analysis**
D.Light faces competition at various levels:
- **Brand Competition**: Government-provided electricity (though unreliable in rural areas) competes directly with solar solutions.
- **Industry Competition**: Low-quality solar lights, often unreliable, create skepticism toward the entire industry.
- **Form Competition**: Alternatives such as kerosene lamps, biomass fuels, truck batteries, and diesel generators fulfill the same lighting needs.
- **Generic Competition**: Competing demands for limited financial resources, such as:
  - Education and school fees.
  - Household expenses and healthcare.
  - Agricultural investments and debt repayment.
