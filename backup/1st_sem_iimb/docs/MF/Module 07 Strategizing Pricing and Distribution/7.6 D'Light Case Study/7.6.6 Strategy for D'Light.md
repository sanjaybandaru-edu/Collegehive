## **Understanding the Challenge**

### **Key Insights**
1. **No Single Channel is Sufficient**:
   - Rural entrepreneurs, village retailers, centralized shops, non-profits, and corporate partnerships each have strengths and limitations.
   - A single channel cannot meet all organizational and customer needs effectively.

2. **Need for Hybrid Channel Design**:
   - Combining multiple channels ensures scalability, accessibility, and profitability.
   - Collaboration between centralized hubs, localized entrepreneurs, and retail networks can address diverse needs.

3. **Priority on S250 Model**:
   - Selling more **S250 units** is critical for profitability.
   - While the **S10 model** is easier to sell due to lower upfront costs, it does not generate sufficient revenue to sustain operations.

## **Proposed Channel Combinations**

### **1. Centralized Shops + Rural Entrepreneurs**

  - Rural entrepreneurs handle last-mile distribution, product demos, and customer engagement.

## **Final Thoughts**

The distribution strategy for D.Light requires a **multi-layered approach** that balances scalability, accessibility, and profitability. A hybrid channel design leveraging centralized hubs, local entrepreneurs, and corporate partnerships can ensure wide-reaching impact while focusing on the sale of higher-margin products like the S250.

This case highlights the complexity of distribution decisions and the need to adapt to both customer and organizational constraints. By combining different channel alternatives and continuously refining the model, D.Light can achieve its goal of transforming lives through affordable solar lighting in rural India.
