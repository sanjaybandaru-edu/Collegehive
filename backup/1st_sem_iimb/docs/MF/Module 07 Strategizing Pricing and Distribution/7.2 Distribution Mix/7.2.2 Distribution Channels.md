## **Examples of Distribution Channel Workflows**
### **1. Commodities**  
- Farmers produce goods such as onions and potatoes.  
- These products move through the following stages:  
  - **Central Warehouse**: Large warehouses located in regions like Bangalore, Mumbai, or Delhi.  
  - **Retailers**: Products are then procured by retailers from the warehouse.  
  - **Consumers**: Finally, the products reach the consumers via retail outlets.

### **2. Perishable Goods**  
- Products such as tomatoes, cucumbers, cauliflower, milk, and eggs require a different approach:  
  - **Daily Procurement**: From wholesale markets, perishables are gathered almost daily.  
  - **Retail Market**: These items are distributed to local wet markets or supermarkets.  
  - **Consumers**: From these retail points, perishables are sold to the end-users.
