# 7.3.1 Types of wholesaling intermediaries​

Wholesaling intermediaries play a critical role in the distribution of goods, enabling the movement of products from manufacturers to retailers. Their key contribution lies in creating **time and place utility**, ensuring that goods are available when and where they are needed. 

There are three main types of wholesaling intermediaries: **merchant wholesalers**, **agent wholesalers (agents or brokers)**, and **manufacturer’s own branches or sales offices**. Below is a detailed explanation of each type.

## **Types of Wholesaling Intermediaries**

### **1. Merchant Wholesalers**
- **Definition**: Merchant wholesalers are independent entities that take title (ownership) of goods.  
- **Key Activities**:
  - Purchase goods from manufacturers and store them.
  - Sell and distribute goods to retailers or other intermediaries.
  - Often provide additional services such as financing, risk-bearing, transportation, and standardization.  
- **Full-Service Wholesalers**:
  - Offer a wide range of marketing services such as selling, buying, storing, transporting, financing, and gathering market information.
- **Limited-Service Wholesalers**:
  - Perform specific functions only.
  - Example: **Carry and Forward (C&F) Agents**—focus solely on transporting goods to the next downstream intermediary without adding significant value.
