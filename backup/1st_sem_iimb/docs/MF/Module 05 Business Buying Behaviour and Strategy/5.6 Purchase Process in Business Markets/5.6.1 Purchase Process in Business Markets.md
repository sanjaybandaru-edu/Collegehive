# 5.6.1 Purchase Process in Business Markets

In B2B markets, the purchase and sales processes differ significantly from B2C. The complexities arise due to the involvement of multiple decision-makers, high-value transactions, and broader organizational impact.

## Example of B2B Requirements Mapping

When a manufacturing company decides to purchase a new machining center, each member of the buying center may have different concerns:
- **Factory Head**: Installation time and operator training.
- **Maintenance Manager**: Service contracts and machine reliability.
- **Procurement Manager**: Pricing details.
- **CEO**: Impact on profitability and ROI.
- **COO**: Switchover time and operational challenges.
- **CFO**: Financial terms of the deal.

## Strategy for B2B Marketers

1. **Identify Key Stakeholders**:
   - Determine all members of the buying center and their specific needs.
   - Understand which members hold significant influence over the decision.

2. **Tailor Communications**:
   - Align the product's benefits to the unique requirements of each stakeholder.
   - Ensure messaging addresses the concerns of influencers and decision-makers effectively.

3. **Assess Influence and Criteria**:
   - Evaluate the role and influence of each stakeholder.
   - Understand their decision criteria to position the product accordingly.

## Stages in the B2B Buying Process

1. **Problem Recognition**:
   - Initiated by identifying a need within the organization.

2. **General Need Description**:
   - All relevant departments contribute to outlining their specific requirements.

3. **Product Specification**:
   - Develop a comprehensive list of minimum criteria and specifications.

4. **Supplier Search**:
   - Tendering process to identify potential suppliers.

5. **Proposal Solicitation**:
   - Suppliers submit proposals, including product details, company credentials, and past experiences.

6. **Supplier Selection**:
   - Evaluate suppliers based on:
     - **Technical Bids**: Product specifications and capabilities.
     - **Financial Bids**: Cost considerations.
   - Selection is typically weighted (e.g., 70% technical, 30% financial).

7. **Order Routine Specification**:
   - Finalize contracts, including frequency, lead times, and delivery terms.

8. **Performance Review**:
   - Assess supplier performance based on quality, delivery, and adherence to terms.
   - Contracts may be renewed or terminated based on satisfaction.

## Types of B2B Buying Situations

1. **Straight Rebuy**:
   - Routine purchases of standard items (e.g., consumables like paper or office supplies).
   - Minimal steps are involved; typically need identification and placing the order.

2. **Modified Rebuy**:
   - Similar products with slight changes in specifications (e.g., paper for color printing).
   - Requires need assessment and updated specifications but uses existing vendors.

3. **New Task**:
   - Complex, high-value, first-time purchases.
   - Involves all steps in the buying process.

## Simplifying Complexity

Just like in B2C, the complexity of the purchase process depends on the level of involvement:
- **Straight Rebuy**: Minimal involvement.
- **Modified Rebuy**: Moderate involvement.
- **New Task**: High involvement, requiring detailed evaluation and multi-step processes.
