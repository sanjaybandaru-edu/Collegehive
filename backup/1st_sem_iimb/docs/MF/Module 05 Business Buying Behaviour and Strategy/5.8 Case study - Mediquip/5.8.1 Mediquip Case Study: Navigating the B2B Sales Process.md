## Case Analysis: MediQuip’s Lost CT Scanner Order at Lowman University Hospital

## 1. Who is Responsible for Losing the Deal?
The failure to secure the order for MediQuip's CT scanner can be attributed to multiple factors and individuals:

### **Key Individuals**
1. **Kurt Thaldorf (Sales Engineer)**: 
   - **Strengths**:
     - Persistent and engaged consistently with the hospital over eight months.
     - Highlighted the technological superiority of MediQuip’s CT scanner.
   - **Weaknesses**:
     - Mismanagement of relationships:
       - He allowed administrative instructions (from Hartmann) to prevent discussions about pricing with Steinborn, the key influencer.
       - Failed to build trust or rapport with Hartmann, the final decision-maker.
     - Reactive rather than proactive:
       - Relied heavily on brochures and technical materials without engaging more creatively or meaningfully with stakeholders like Ruffer and Hartmann.
       - Missed opportunities to directly address pricing concerns or involve stakeholders more deeply (e.g., rejected the idea of a headquarters visit in September).
     - Delayed price adjustments:
       - The initial quote of €1.6M set a negative tone, creating a perception of high cost without immediate justification.
       - The final offer of €1.3M came too late and may not have been communicated effectively to the decision-makers.

2. **Carl Hartmann (Hospital General Director)**:
   - **Strengths**:
     - Practical decision-maker focused on price and value for the hospital.
   - **Weaknesses**:
     - Lack of transparency:
       - Evaded questions about the decision-making process and the weightage of factors like price versus technology.
     - Possibly biased toward Sigma:
       - May have favored Sigma due to existing relationships or a preference for lower-cost solutions, regardless of technological superiority.

3. **Professor Steinborn (Radiologist and Key Influencer)**:
   - **Strengths**:
     - Advocated for the best technological solution.
     - Appreciated MediQuip’s technical features and upgrading schemes.
   - **Weaknesses**:
     - Limited influence over pricing:
       - His inability to influence Hartmann or overcome administrative instructions weakened his position as a champion for MediQuip.

4. **Dr. Ruffer (Physicist)**:
   - Played a minimal role in advocating for MediQuip or providing substantial feedback, reflecting disengagement.

### **Conclusion**:
The primary responsibility lies with **Thaldorf**, as he failed to manage relationships, address pricing concerns early, and adequately involve or persuade key stakeholders like Hartmann. Secondary responsibility falls on **Hartmann** for his fixation on price and lack of clarity in the decision-making process.

## 2. Key Day When the Order Was Lost
The pivotal moment occurred on **June 23rd**. 

### **Key Issues on June 23rd**:
1. **Hartmann’s Administrative Instructions**:
   - Prohibited Thaldorf from discussing pricing with Steinborn.
   - Steinborn, a key influencer, became frustrated as he was unable to make a compelling case for MediQuip internally due to the lack of price clarity.

2. **Competitor’s Pricing Visibility**:
   - Sigma had already provided a quote of €1.2M.
   - Thaldorf’s inability to offer a competitive or clear price on the spot further weakened MediQuip’s position.

### **Impact**:
This day marked the moment when MediQuip lost Steinborn’s full support, which was crucial for influencing the committee’s decision.

---

## 3. What Could Have Been Done Differently?
### **Key Improvements**:
1. **Proactive Pricing Strategy**:
   - Provide a competitive price earlier in the process, ideally by the first week of June.
   - Justify the premium price with a clear cost-benefit analysis showing long-term savings from technological superiority.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - Build a stronger relationship with Hartmann:
     - Address his concerns directly through a series of structured meetings.
     - Leverage testimonials or case studies from other hospitals using MediQuip’s system.
   - Involve Steinborn more effectively:
     - Seek his advice on presenting the value proposition to the hospital administration.
     - Encourage his advocacy by sharing specific examples of how MediQuip’s technology benefits radiologists.

3. **Enhance Communication**:
   - Reject or revise the administrative instruction that prevented price discussions with Steinborn.
   - Propose the Paris headquarters visit in **June or July** to demonstrate the product's capabilities and build credibility.

4. **Timely Decision-Making**:
   - Offer the final price of €1.3M earlier (e.g., by **July 15th**) to ensure the hospital’s committee had sufficient time to consider it.

5. **Cross-functional Collaboration**:
   - Involve the regional manager and product specialists in meetings with Hartmann and the committee to address technical and financial concerns comprehensively.
