	| **Total Overheads** | | 93,260 | 100,320 |
	| **Estimated Direct Labour Hours** | | 186,000 | 217,000 |
	| **Overhead Rate** (Total Overheads / Direct Labour Hours) | | 0.50 | 0.46 |
	
	### Working Notes
	
	1. **Electricity:** 
	   - At 60% capacity, the fixed part is Rs (30,000 * 40% = 12,000) and the variable part is Rs (30,000 * 60% = 18,000). Total is Rs (12,000 + 18,000 = 30,000).
	   - At 70% capacity, the fixed part remains Rs 12,000 and the variable part is Rs (18,000/60 * 70 = 21,000), totaling Rs (12,000 + 21,000 = 33,000).
	
	2. **Repairs:** 
	   - At 60% capacity, fixed part is Rs (3,000 * 80% = 2,400) and the variable part is Rs (3,000 * 20% * 60% = 360). Total is Rs (2,400 + 360 = 2,760).
	   - At 70% capacity, fixed part remains Rs 2,400 and variable part increases to Rs (3,000 * 20% * 70% = 420), totaling Rs (2,400 + 420 = 2,820).

=== "Question 3"
	## Question
	
	Prepare a flexible budget for a factory's production of 600 units and 800 units, given the expenses budgeted for 1,000 units are as follows:
	
	- **Material Cost per unit:** Rs. 700
	- **Labour Cost per unit:** Rs. 250
	- **Variable overheads per unit:** Rs. 200
	- **Selling expenses per unit:** Rs. 130 (20% fixed)
	- **Administrative expenses:** Rs. 200,000 (fixed)
	
	### Working Notes
	
	1. **Material, Labour, and Variable Overheads** scale directly with the number of units produced.
	2. **Selling Expenses** are semi-variable:
	   - Fixed component: 20% of Rs. 130 = Rs. 26 per unit
	   - Variable component: 80% of Rs. 130 = Rs. 104 per unit
	3. **Administrative Expenses** remain constant at all production levels as they are fixed.
	
	### Calculations
	
	1. **For 600 Units:**
	   - Materials: Rs. 700 x 600 = Rs. 420,000
	   - Labour: Rs. 250 x 600 = Rs. 150,000
	   - Variable overheads: Rs. 200 x 600 = Rs. 120,000
	   - Variable selling expenses: Rs. 104 x 600 = Rs. 62,400
	   - Fixed selling expenses: Rs. 26 x 600 = Rs. 15,600
	   - Total cost = Sum of above + fixed administrative expenses
	
	2. **For 800 Units:**
	   - Materials: Rs. 700 x 800 = Rs. 560,000
	   - Labour: Rs. 250 x 800 = Rs. 200,000
	   - Variable overheads: Rs. 200 x 800 = Rs. 160,000
	   - Variable selling expenses: Rs. 104 x 800 = Rs. 83,200
	   - Fixed selling expenses: Rs. 26 x 800 = Rs. 20,800
	   - Total cost = Sum of above + fixed administrative expenses
	
	### Solution
	
	
	| Particulars               | Per Unit Rs. | Total Rs. (600 Units) | Per Unit Rs. | Total Rs. (800 Units) |
	|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
	| **Variable Cost:**        |              |                       |              |                       |
	| Materials                 | 700          | 420,000               | 700          | 560,000               |
	| Labour                    | 250          | 150,000               | 250          | 200,000               |
	| Variable Overheads        | 200          | 120,000               | 200          | 160,000               |
	| **Semi-variable Cost:**   |              |                       |              |                       |
	| Variable Selling Expenses | 104          | 62,400                | 104          | 83,200                |
	| Fixed Selling Expenses    | 26           | 15,600                | 26           | 20,800                |
	| **Fixed Cost:**           |              |                       |              |                       |
	| Administrative Expenses   | 333.33       | 200,000               | 250          | 200,000               |
	| **Total Cost (A+B+C)**    | 1,630.66     | 978,000               | 1,536.50     | 1,224,000             |
	
	### Explanation
	
	This flexible budget adjusts the cost structure for different levels of production (600 and 800 units). Each component of the costs is scaled accordingly:
	
	- **Variable Costs** (materials, labour, and variable overheads) increase linearly with the number of units.
	- **Semi-variable Costs** for selling expenses are split into fixed and variable parts, calculated per unit.
	- **Fixed Costs**, such as administrative expenses, remain unchanged regardless of the number of units produced, showing the impact of fixed costs on the total budget as the production volume changes.
	
	This budget aids in planning and cost management for varying production levels, demonstrating how total costs and per unit costs fluctuate with changes in the production scale.
 
=== "Question 4"
	## Question
	
	The task is to prepare a flexible budget for production levels of 50% and 75% capacity based on the budgeted output at 100% capacity (6,400 units) with total costs amounting to Rs. 1,76,048. This will include the effect of maintaining the selling price per unit at Rs. 40 on net profit. The budget will also account for unchanged administrative, selling, and distribution expenses totaling Rs. 3,600.
	
	### Existing Budget Details at 100% Capacity (6,400 units):
	
	- **Fixed Costs:** Rs. 20,688
	- **Variable Costs:**
	  - **Power:** Rs. 1,440
	  - **Repairs:** Rs. 1,700
	  - **Miscellaneous:** Rs. 540
	  - **Direct Material:** Rs. 49,280
	  - **Direct Labour:** Rs. 102,400
	  - **Total Variable Costs:** Rs. 155,360
	- **Total Costs:** Rs. 176,048
	- **Sales Revenue:** Rs. 256,000 (6,400 units * Rs. 40 per unit)
	- **Net Profit:** Calculated as Sales - Total Costs - Administrative, Selling, and Distribution Expenses
	
	### Flexible Budget at 50% and 75% Capacities:
	
	#### Sales and Cost Calculation:
	- **Sales Revenue per Unit:** Rs. 40
	- **Administrative, Selling, and Distribution Costs:** Rs. 3,600 (constant at all levels)
	
	#### Variable Costs Adjustment:
	Variable costs scale linearly with production volume:
	- **At 50% Capacity (3,200 units)**
	- **At 75% Capacity (4,800 units)**
	
	### Solution
	
	
	| Particulars                 | 100% Capacity (6,400 Units) | 75% Capacity (4,800 Units) | 50% Capacity (3,200 Units) |
	|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
	| **Sales Revenue (Rs. 40/unit)** | 256,000                     | 192,000                    | 128,000                    |
	| **Cost of Sales:**          |                             |                            |                            |
	| Direct Material             | 49,280                      | 36,960                     | 24,640                     |
	| Direct Labour               | 102,400                     | 76,800                     | 51,200                     |
	| Power                       | 1,440                       | 1,080                      | 720                        |
	| Repairs                     | 1,700                       | 1,275                      | 850                        |
	| Miscellaneous               | 540                         | 405                        | 270                        |
	| **Total Variable Costs**    | 155,360                     | 116,520                    | 77,680                     |
	| **Fixed Costs**             | 20,688                      | 20,688                     | 20,688                     |
	| **Total Costs**             | 176,048                     | 137,208                    | 98,368                     |

	| **Less: Adm., Selling, and Dist. Costs** | 3,600          | 3,600                      | 3,600                      |
	| **Net Profit**              | 76,352                      | 51,192                     | 26,032                     |
	
	### Explanation
	
	- The budget adjusts the variable costs (direct material, direct labour, power, repairs, and miscellaneous) according to the production level.
	- Fixed costs (administrative, selling, and distribution expenses) remain constant across different production levels.
	- The net profit is derived after subtracting total costs (including fixed costs and variable costs) and administrative, selling, and distribution expenses from the sales revenue.
	- As production capacity decreases, both sales revenue and variable costs decrease, but fixed costs remain constant, impacting the net profit.

=== "Question 5"
	## Question
	## Current Situation at 40% Capacity
	- **Production**: 10,000 buckets/month
	- **Materials**: Rs. 10 per bucket
	- **Labour**: Rs. 3 per bucket
	- **Overheads**: Rs. 5 per bucket (60% fixed, i.e., Rs. 3 fixed and Rs. 2 variable)
	- **Selling Price**: Rs. 20 per bucket

	## Adjusted Scenarios
	1. **50% Capacity**: 
	   - Selling price falls by 3% (Rs. 20 - 3% = Rs. 19.40)
	2. **90% Capacity**: 
	   - Selling price falls by 5% (Rs. 20 - 5% = Rs. 19.00)
	   - Material cost falls by 5% (Rs. 10 - 5% = Rs. 9.50)
	
	## Production at Different Capacities
	- **50% Capacity**: \(12,500\) buckets/month
	- **90% Capacity**: \(22,500\) buckets/month
	
	
	
	### Answer
	
	| Particulars                  | 40% Capacity | 50% Capacity | 90% Capacity |
	|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
	| **Production and Sales Units** | 10,000       | 12,500       | 22,500       |
	| **Sales Price per Unit (Rs.)** | 20           | 19.40        | 19.00        |
	| **Sales Amount (Rs.)**         | 2,00,000     | 2,42,500     | 4,27,500     |
	| **Marginal Cost:**            |              |              |              |
	| - Material (Rs.)              | 10           | 10           | 9.50         |
	| - Labour (Rs.)                | 3            | 3            | 3            |
	| - Variable Overhead (Rs.)     | 2            | 2            | 2            |
	| **Total Variable Cost (Rs.)**  | 1,50,000     | 1,87,500     | 3,26,250     |
	| **Contribution (Rs.)**         | 50,000       | 55,000       | 1,01,250     |
	| **Fixed Costs (Rs.)**          | 30,000       | 30,000       | 30,000       |
	| **Profit (Rs.)**               | 20,000       | 25,000       | 71,250       |
	| **Contribution per Unit (Rs.)**| 5            | 4.40         | 4.50         |
	| **Break-even Point (Units)**   | 6,000        | 6,818        | 6,667        |
	
	## Notes
	
	- **Contribution per Unit** is calculated as (Sales Price per Unit - Total Variable Cost per Unit).
	- **Profit** is derived by subtracting fixed costs from the contribution.
	- **Break-even Point (Units)** is calculated as \( \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution per Unit}} \).
	
	## Explanation
	
	- The budget shows an increase in both production and sales as capacity utilization rises from 40% to 90%.
	- A decrease in material costs and selling price at 90% capacity, along with increased production, leads to a higher profit despite a slight decrease in the contribution per unit.
	- Break-even points slightly increase from 6,000 units at 40% capacity to 6,818 at 50% capacity, then decrease slightly at 90% capacity due to a more efficient contribution margin.
