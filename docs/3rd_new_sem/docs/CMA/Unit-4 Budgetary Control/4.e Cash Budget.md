	### Explanation and Insights
	
	- **Cash Flow**: The cash budget reflects a challenging initial few months with negative closing balances, which improve as sales volume increases and credit sales from previous months are collected. The company may need an overdraft or additional financing for initial months until it stabilizes with positive cash flows in June.
	- **Expenses Timing**: Materials costs reflect the purchase for the subsequent month's production, showing a lag which impacts cash flow.
	- **Credit Management**: Efficient management of credit sales and timely collection is crucial as it forms a significant portion of the revenue and impacts cash flow directly.
	
	This budget will help Tata Co. Ltd. in planning their finances, anticipating cash shortfalls, and arranging necessary funds or credit facilities in advance to ensure smooth operations and growth during the initial months of production.

	### Explanation:
	
	- The cash budget table starts with an opening balance in July of Rs. 55,000.
	- Receipts each month include the collection from debtors as per the sales made in previous months.
	- Total receipts are the sum of the opening balance and collections.
	- Payments each month include payments to suppliers for raw materials purchased in the previous month, as well as monthly salary, lease, miscellaneous expenses, and other specified expenses like income tax and research.
	- Total payments are the sum of all the payments made in the month.
	- The closing balance for each month is the total receipts minus the total payments. This balance is carried forward as the opening balance for the next month.
	- In September and October, there are significant payments (including income tax and research payments), which result in a negative closing balance in September.
	- The closing balance improves by December, ending with a positive balance of Rs. 1,22,475.
	
	This budget helps in understanding the cash flow needs of the company and planning for sufficient liquidity to cover expenses and obligations throughout the six-month period. It also indicates when the company may need to arrange for additional financing to cover shortfalls.
