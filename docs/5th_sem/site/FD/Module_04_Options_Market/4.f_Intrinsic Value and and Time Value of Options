# Intrinsic Value and Time Value of an Option

### Intrinsic Value:
The immediate gain if the option is exercised.
- **Formula**:
  - Call Option: \( \text{Max}(S_T - K, 0) \)
  - Put Option: \( \text{Max}(K - S_T, 0) \)

### Time Value:
The additional value of the option above its intrinsic value due to the remaining time until expiration.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Time Value} = \text{Option Price} - \text{Intrinsic Value}
  \]

**Example**:
- A call option priced at $15, with a strike price of $40 and a stock price of $50:
  - Intrinsic Value = \( 50 - 40 = $10 \)
  - Time Value = \( 15 - 10 = $5 \)
