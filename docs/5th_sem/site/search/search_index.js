Traded on regulated exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Contract Customization Fully customizable: terms like quantity, price, and settlement date can be tailored. Standardized contracts with fixed terms regarding quantity, expiration, and settlement. Counterparty Risk High counterparty risk due to the absence of a central clearinghouse. Lower counterparty risk, as exchanges use central clearinghouses to guarantee performance. Settlement Typically settled at maturity, with the possibility of physical or cash settlement. Marked to market daily, with gains and losses settled daily; physical or cash settlement at maturity. Margin Requirements No margin requirements, but collateral may be required depending on the parties' agreement. Requires initial and maintenance margins, determined by the exchange. Liquidity Generally less liquid due to the OTC nature and customization of contracts. Highly liquid, with active trading on exchanges and standardized contracts. Regulation Less regulated, with terms and enforcement relying on the agreement between parties. Heavily regulated by exchanges and regulatory bodies, ensuring transparency and compliance. Pricing Transparency Prices are not publicly available, as forwards are privately negotiated. Prices are transparent and publicly available, quoted on exchanges. Typical Users Corporations, financial institutions, and entities with specific hedging needs. Traders, speculators, hedgers, and arbitrageurs in both retail and institutional markets. Contract Settlement Date The settlement date is flexible and mutually agreed upon by the parties. Standardized expiration dates set by the exchange (e.g., monthly, quarterly). Purpose Primarily used for hedging specific risks in commodities, currencies, or interest rates. Used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage across a wide range of markets. Contract Size Variable and negotiated between the contracting parties. Fixed and standardized by the exchange. Example A company and a bank agree on a forward contract to exchange $1 million in six months at a predetermined rate. A trader buys a futures contract to purchase 100 barrels of oil at $70 per barrel, expiring in three months."},{"location":"GB/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Global%20Business/1.a%20Evolution%20of%20International%20Business.html","title":"International Business","text":"<p>International business is the process of linking the global resources with global people.</p>"},{"location":"GB/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Global%20Business/1.a%20Evolution%20of%20International%20Business.html#evolution-of-international-business-a-concise-overview","title":"Evolution of International Business: A Concise Overview","text":"<p>Early Integration (19th Century):</p> <ul> <li>Increased economic integration marked by advancements like steam ships.</li> <li>Seeds of globalization sowed through trade routes and cultural interactions.</li> </ul> <p>Colonial Model (Post-WWI):</p> <ul> <li>Dominant empires extract raw materials from colonies.</li> <li>Finished goods exported back, creating unequal exchange.</li> </ul> <p>Nationalism and Shift (Post-WWII):</p> <ul> <li>Former colonies gain independence, challenge colonial model.</li> <li>Governments protect domestic industries, limiting raw material exports and finished goods imports.</li> </ul> <p>Multilateralism Emerges:</p> <ul> <li>IMF and IBRD (World Bank) established for cooperation and global trade.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"GB/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Global%20Business/1.b%20Nature%20of%20International%20Business.html","title":"NATURE OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS (IB)","text":""},{"location":"GB/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Global%20Business/1.b%20Nature%20of%20International%20Business.html#globalization","title":"Globalization","text":"<p>Globalization represents an attitude of mind - it is a mindset that views the entire world as a single market.

This assumption led to difficulties in the American market, highlighting the pitfalls of an ethnocentric approach.</p> </li> <li> <p>Walt Disney's Cultural Clash in France: Walt Disney's expansion into France with Disneyland Paris was initially met with resistance due to its ethnocentric approach. The company replicated its US theme park model, including a ban on alcohol, which clashed with French cultural norms where wine is commonly consumed with meals.

Moreover, it highlights the role of technological advancement in driving globalisation, as Apple relies on advanced technology for product design, supply chain management, and global communication.</p> <p>Globalisation is a comprehensive process that impacts economic, social, cultural, and political dimensions worldwide. While it offers numerous benefits, such as economic growth, technological advancement, and cultural exchange, it also poses challenges, including inequalities and environmental concerns.

Here are the key elements that typically make up export credit terms:</p> <ol> <li>Interest Rate</li> <li>Description: The interest rate on export credit can be either fixed or variable. It represents the cost of borrowing and is applied to the principal amount extended to the exporter.</li> <li> <p>Factors Influencing Rate: The rate may vary based on market conditions, the creditworthiness of the exporter, and the length of the credit period.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tenor</p> </li> <li>Description: The tenor of export credit refers to the duration over which the credit must be repaid. It is a crucial aspect that dictates the timeline for financial planning for repayment.</li> <li> <p>Variability: The duration can differ based on the nature of the transaction and the agreements between the exporter and the financing institution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repayment Schedule</p> </li> <li>Description: This schedule outlines the specific timings and amounts for repayments that the exporter must adhere to during the credit period.</li> <li> <p>Structure: Repayment can be uniform across the period, or it may vary (e.g., balloon payments or varied installment amounts), depending on the exporter's cash flow and financial strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security and Collateral</p> </li> <li>Description: Exporters are often required to provide some form of security or collateral against the credit they receive. This acts as a safety net for financing institutions against potential defaults.</li> <li> <p>Types of Security: Collateral can include physical assets, guarantees from third parties, or other valuable financial instruments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Grace Period</p> </li> <li>Description: A grace period may be granted, during which the exporter is not required to make principal repayments, or might only need to cover the interest payments.</li> <li> <p>Purpose: This period can help exporters manage their cash flows better, especially if revenue generation from the exported goods is expected to be delayed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Currency</p> </li> <li>Description: The currency in which the credit is denominated is specified in the export credit terms. This could be either the local currency of the exporter or a foreign currency.</li> <li> <p>Selection Factors: The choice of currency is influenced by the preferences of the involved parties and the primary currency used in international trade transactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fees and Charges</p> </li> <li>Description: Additional fees and charges may apply to the export credit, which are meant to cover the administrative costs associated with managing and processing the credit.</li> <li>Examples: These fees can include processing fees, commitment fees, documentation fees, and may vary according to the complexity of the export transaction and the services offered by the financing institution.</li> </ol> <p>Understanding these terms not only helps exporters in managing their financial liabilities but also in negotiating better terms with financing institutions. Proper knowledge of these factors ensures a smoother transaction process and can potentially improve the profitability and sustainability of export

Investment refers to the process of using money to purchase assets with the expectation of generating returns in the future. Purpose Savings are typically made to fulfill short-term goals or for immediate needs, like emergencies or upcoming expenses. Investments are made with the intention of achieving long-term financial goals like retirement, wealth creation, or capital appreciation. Risk Savings generally carry low or negligible risk, as your funds are usually held in insured accounts like savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs). Investments involve varying degrees of risk, depending on the chosen asset class. Stocks and real estate may offer higher potential returns but carry higher risk, while bonds tend to offer lower risk but also lower returns. Returns Savings accounts typically offer low or no interest, meaning your money doesn't grow significantly over time. Investments have the potential to generate higher returns compared to savings. However, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and there's always a chance of losing money. Liquidity Savings are highly liquid, meaning you can easily access your money when needed. Investments can be less liquid, depending on the asset type. Stocks and bonds typically have high liquidity, while real estate or venture capital investments may be less accessible in the short term."},{"location":"SAPM/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Investment%20and%20Investment%20Avenues/1.b%20Comparison%20between%20Savings%2C%20Investment%2C%20Speculation%20and%20Gambling.html#speculation","title":"Speculation","text":"<p>Definition: The act of trading in an asset, or conducting a financial transaction, that has a significant risk of losing most or all of the initial outlay, in expectation of a substantial gain.</p> <ul> <li>Planning Horizon: Speculators have a very short planning horizon, usually extending from a few days to a few months.</li> <li>Risk: Speculators are ready to take very high levels of risk, often willing to lose their basic capital.</li> <li>Return Expectation: Speculators usually have very high return expectations and are prepared to bear high risks for potential gains.</li> <li>Basis of Decisions: Speculation gives more importance to technical charts, news, and market sentiments.</li> <li>Leverage: Speculators may invest borrowed funds and create leverage positions to maximize potential returns.</li> </ul> Points of Comparison Investor Speculator Planning Horizon Usually investors have longer investment horizon which leads to few years.

These canons primarily address the administrative and operational aspects of taxation, ensuring that taxes are collected efficiently, fairly, and in a manner that supports the broader economic goals of a nation. The concept of canons of taxation was first articulated by the renowned economist Adam Smith in his seminal work \"The Wealth of Nations\" in 1776. Smith's principles laid the groundwork for modern taxation practices and continue to be highly relevant even in today's complex economic landscape. Governments around the world still apply these classic canons when designing and implementing tax policies, as they provide a timeless framework for ensuring that taxation is just, effective, and conducive to economic stability.</p>"},{"location":"TAX/Module_01_INTRODUCTION_TO_TAXATION/1.a_Legal_enactments_governing_Income_Tax_in_India.html#types-of-canons-of-taxation","title":"Types of Canons of Taxation","text":"<p>Adam Smith originally identified four core canons of taxation, each addressing a different aspect of the tax system. Over time, modern economists have expanded on these principles, adding new canons that reflect the evolving needs and complexities of contemporary economies.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Equality (or Equity) oncept: The Canon of Equality is based on the principle that the tax burden should be distributed equitably among all taxpayers. This means that individuals and entities with a higher ability to pay, such as the wealthy, should contribute more in taxes than those with lesser means. The concept of equity in taxation aligns closely with the idea of \"ability to pay,\" ensuring that the sacrifice made by each taxpayer is proportionate to their income or wealth. The goal is to achieve fairness in taxation, where the tax system does not disproportionately burden any particular group, especially the economically disadvantaged.</li> </ul> <p>Application: In practice, progressive tax systems embody this canon by imposing higher tax rates on higher income brackets. For instance, income tax systems that charge higher rates on higher incomes ensure that wealthier individuals pay a larger share of their earnings in taxes, thereby maintaining equity in the distribution of tax burdens.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Certainty Concept: The Canon of Certainty emphasizes that the tax liabilities of individuals and entities should be clear, definite, and predictable. Taxpayers should know in advance the amount they are required to pay, the due dates, and the method of payment. Similarly, the government should have a clear understanding of the expected revenue from taxes within a specific period. This certainty reduces the scope for arbitrary taxation and ensures that taxpayers can plan their finances accordingly without facing unexpected tax demands.</li> </ul> <p>Application: Certainty in taxation is crucial for both taxpayers and the government. For taxpayers, it provides the assurance needed to make informed financial decisions. For the government, it ensures a stable and predictable flow of revenue. This canon is reflected in tax laws that clearly define tax rates, deadlines, and penalties, as well as in the transparent communication of these rules to the public.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Economy Concept: The Canon of Economy relates to the cost-efficiency of tax collection. It asserts that the cost of collecting taxes should be minimized so that the maximum possible revenue is made available to the government after accounting for administrative expenses. A tax system that incurs high collection costs is inefficient, as it reduces the net revenue available for public spending. The principle is to ensure that the process of tax collection is streamlined, cost-effective, and free of unnecessary complexity.</li> </ul> <p>Application: The Canon of Economy is observed by designing tax systems that are easy to administer and enforce. This includes the use of modern technology to reduce manual processing, simplifying tax forms, and ensuring that tax laws are clear and straightforward to avoid extensive litigation and disputes. By minimizing collection costs, the government can maximize the funds available for public services and infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Convenience Concept: The Canon of Convenience states that taxes should be levied and collected in a manner that is most convenient for taxpayers. This means that the timing, method, and manner of payment should cause the least inconvenience to those who are required to pay taxes. A tax system that is easy to comply with encourages higher rates of voluntary compliance and reduces the likelihood of tax evasion.</li> </ul> <p>Application: Tax authorities implement this canon by aligning tax payment schedules with times when taxpayers are most likely to have liquidity. For example, agricultural taxes are typically collected after harvest, when farmers have cash on hand. Similarly, salaried employees often have taxes deducted at source, which aligns with their receipt of income and reduces the burden of making lump-sum payments later.</p> <p>Additional Canons Introduced by Modern Economists Building on Adam Smith's foundational canons, modern economists have identified additional principles that address the complexities of contemporary tax systems.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Productivity Concept: The Canon of Productivity, introduced by classical economist Charles F. Bastable, emphasizes that taxes should be productive in the sense that they generate sufficient revenue for the government without discouraging economic activity. A productive tax system is one that raises substantial revenue while also fostering economic growth by not imposing excessive burdens on productive efforts.</li> </ul> <p>Application: A tax is considered productive if it raises significant revenue without creating disincentives for work, investment, or production. For example, a well-designed corporate tax system that provides incentives for businesses to invest in growth can be both productive and supportive of economic development.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Elasticity Concept: The Canon of Elasticity implies that a tax system should be flexible and capable of adjusting to changing economic conditions. Elasticity in taxation means that tax rates can be modified to respond to the financial needs of the government, such as during times of economic crisis or increased public expenditure.</li> </ul> <p>Application: Elastic tax systems allow governments to increase or decrease tax rates in response to economic cycles. For example, during a recession, a government might lower certain tax rates to stimulate spending, whereas during a period of high public expenditure, it might increase taxes to raise additional revenue.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Simplicity Concept: The Canon of Simplicity advocates for a tax system that is easy to understand and comply with. Complexity in tax laws can lead to confusion, increase compliance costs, and create opportunities for tax evasion. A simple tax system ensures that taxpayers can easily calculate their tax liabilities without requiring professional assistance.</li> </ul> <p>Application: Simplicity in taxation is achieved by minimizing the number of tax brackets, simplifying tax forms, and providing clear guidelines. Tax authorities can enhance simplicity by using plain language in communication and reducing the number of deductions and exemptions that complicate the tax filing process.</p> <ul> <li>Canon of Diversity Concept: The Canon of Diversity suggests that a tax system should include a variety of taxes rather than relying heavily on a single tax source. A diversified tax system spreads the tax burden across different sectors of the economy, reducing the impact on any one group and making the overall system more resilient to economic fluctuations.</li> </ul> <p>Application: A diversified tax structure might include income taxes, corporate taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), property taxes, and excise duties. By diversifying its tax base, a government can ensure a more stable revenue stream and mitigate the risks associated with economic downturns in specific sectors.</p>"},{"location":"TAX/Module_01_INTRODUCTION_TO_TAXATION/1.a_Legal_enactments_governing_Income_Tax_in_India.html#purposes-of-taxation","title":"Purposes of Taxation","text":"<p>Taxation serves multiple purposes within an economy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Raising Revenue for the Government: The primary function of taxation is to generate revenue for the government to fund public services, infrastructure, and administration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Redistributing Income and Wealth: Taxes are used as a tool to reduce income inequality by transferring resources from wealthier individuals to those who are less affluent.
