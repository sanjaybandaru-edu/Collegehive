# Integration of Global Supply Chain Functions

## 1. Introduction to Supply Chain Integration

Supply chain integration is the process where all stakeholders involved in creating, distributing, and supporting an end product or service are seamlessly connected. The primary objective of an integrated supply chain is to ensure that everyone within the supply chain network is working towards the same goal while optimizing overall performance.

### 1.1 What is Supply Chain Integration?

Supply chain integration refers to the sharing of information and coordination among supply chain partners throughout the lifecycle of a product, from inception to delivery. This integration is critical for enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving responsiveness to market changes.

## 2. Different Levels of Supply Chain Integration

Supply chain integration can be categorized into three distinct levels: Operational, Planned/Tactical, and Strategic. Each level represents a different stage of integration and collaboration among supply chain partners.

### 2.1 Operational Level

- **Overview**: The first level of supply chain integration is the operational level, which focuses on the optimization of individual processes.
- **Characteristics**: At this level, businesses concentrate on improving specific processes, such as procurement, manufacturing, or logistics, often in isolation. The impact of these optimizations on other processes is not always considered.
- **Objective**: The goal is to enhance the efficiency of individual processes, but without a holistic view of the entire supply chain.

### 2.2 Planned/Tactical Level

- **Overview**: The Planned/Tactical level of supply chain integration emphasizes the integration of responsibilities and authorities across the organization.
- **Characteristics**: This phase involves the coordination of material flow at an organizational level and the implementation of information systems to support these processes across the company.
- **Objective**: The focus is on creating a cohesive plan for material flow and utilizing information technology to enhance coordination within the organization.

### 2.3 Strategic Level

- **Overview**: The Strategic level of supply chain integration is the most advanced, focusing on fostering partnerships, alliances, and relationships among all stakeholders within the supply chain.
- **Characteristics**: At this level, companies design and integrate inter-organizational information systems and processes that facilitate collaboration between different companies within the supply chain. This involves long-term strategic planning and collaboration at the supply chain level.
- **Objective**: The primary goal is to create a seamless and collaborative network that strengthens relationships, improves transparency, and enhances the overall efficiency and resilience of the supply chain.

## 3. Integrated Supply Chain Management

### 3.1 Importance of Integrated Supply Chain Management

Supply chain integration is essential for strengthening the entire supply chain by improving relationships among all stakeholders, such as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers, customers, and shippers. When these links in the supply chain are seamlessly connected, the entire system becomes more robust and efficient.

### 3.2 Benefits of Supply Chain Integration

- **Transparency and Visibility**: Supply chain integration increases transparency and visibility across the supply chain, enabling businesses to make more informed, data-driven decisions.
- **Improved Relationships**: By fostering stronger relationships among stakeholders, companies can create a more collaborative and cooperative environment.
- **Optimized Performance**: Integrated supply chains ensure that all stakeholders are aligned towards common goals, leading to optimized performance and better business outcomes.

## 4. Conclusion

Supply chain integration is a critical component of modern supply chain management. By progressing through the levels of integration—from Operational to Planned/Tactical to Strategic—companies can achieve a fully integrated supply chain that is not only efficient but also resilient and responsive to the complexities of the global market.
