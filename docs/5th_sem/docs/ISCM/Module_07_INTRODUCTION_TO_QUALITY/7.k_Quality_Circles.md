## What is a Quality Circle?

A **Quality Circle (QC)** is a technique in which a group of employees use participative management to identify and solve problems related to the performance or quality of a product. In a quality circle, small teams of employees meet regularly to discuss, evaluate, and address quality-related challenges within an organization. This approach not only improves productivity and quality but also enhances employees' quality of work life and overall organizational performance.

### Key Benefits of Quality Circles:
- Promotes employee dedication and commitment.
