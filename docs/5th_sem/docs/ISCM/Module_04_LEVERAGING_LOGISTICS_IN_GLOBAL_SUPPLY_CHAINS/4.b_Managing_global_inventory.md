# Managing global inventory

**Inventory Management** refers to the process of ordering, storing, using, and selling a company's inventory. This process encompasses all aspects of inventory, including:

- **Raw Materials**: The basic materials a company acquires to produce goods.
- **Components**: Parts used in manufacturing.
- **Finished Products**: Items ready for sale.
- **Warehousing**: Storage of inventory in a secure, organized manner.
- **Processing**: Movement and handling of inventory within a facility.

Effective inventory management helps businesses maintain optimal inventory levels, avoiding shortages and surpluses, thus supporting smooth operations and customer satisfaction.

## Key Goals of Inventory Management

Inventory management aims to efficiently streamline inventory to avoid excesses (gluts) and shortages, maintaining a balance that aligns with customer demand and production needs.

## Methods of Inventory Management

Businesses use different inventory management methods based on their needs, each with advantages and disadvantages. Four widely used methods include:

1. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Management**: 
   - Products are ordered and received only as they are needed in the production process.
   - Reduces storage costs but requires precise demand forecasting and quick supplier response times.

2. **Materials Requirement Planning (MRP)**:
   - A production planning and inventory control system to ensure materials are available for production and products for delivery.
   - Helps coordinate production schedules but can be complex and costly to implement.

3. **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**:
   - A method that determines the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs, including ordering and holding costs.
   - Suitable for businesses with consistent demand but may not adapt well to sudden demand changes.

4. **Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)**:
   - Measures how many days it typically takes to sell the average inventory.
   - Helps in evaluating inventory efficiency but may not provide immediate actionable insights.

## Accounting for Inventory

Inventory is accounted for in several ways, depending on the method used. These methods include:

- **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: Assumes the oldest inventory items are sold first.
- **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)**: Assumes the newest inventory items are sold first.
- **Weighted-Average Costing**: Calculates a weighted average of all inventory costs.

### Categories of Inventory

1. **Raw Materials**: Purchased materials that require processing before they can be sold as a finished product.
2. **Work in Process (WIP)**: Inventory currently in production, not yet ready for sale.
3. **Finished Goods**: Completed products available for sale to customers.
4. **Merchandise**: Finished goods acquired from suppliers for resale, typical for retail businesses.

## Global Inventory Management in Supply Chain

In a global supply chain, inventory management involves tracking inventory from the point of manufacture to warehouses and then to the point of sale. Effective **global inventory management** aims to place the right products in the right place at the right time, ensuring seamless supply chain operations.

### Managing Global Inventory

Managing global inventory requires a straightforward yet flexible interface, enabling businesses to oversee millions of products across multiple locations. Key aspects include:

- **Visibility**: Clear visibility into inventory levels and movements across all locations.
- **Accessibility**: Easy-to-use systems that enable quick responses to inventory needs.

## Challenges in Global Inventory Management

Global inventory management faces several challenges due to the complex nature of international supply chains. Common challenges include:

- **Demand Variability**: Unpredictable changes in demand that affect inventory needs.
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Events such as natural disasters or geopolitical issues that can interrupt the supply chain.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Difficulty in accurately predicting customer demand, which affects stock levels.
- **Lack of Visibility**: Limited insight into inventory across all locations, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Supply Chain Fragmentation**: Managing multiple suppliers and facilities across regions can complicate inventory tracking.
- **Labor Shortages**: Shortage of workers to handle inventory and logistics tasks.
- **Technological Limitations**: Older systems may not support complex, real-time global inventory management.
- **High Storage Costs**: The cost of warehousing goods across multiple locations can add up, especially when demand is unpredictable.

## Conclusion

Inventory management is a foundational component of supply chain management, essential for maintaining a balance between meeting customer demand and minimizing excess inventory. While various methods exist to manage inventory, the right approach depends on a company's unique needs, the nature of its products, and the structure of its supply chain. With global inventory management, businesses can effectively coordinate inventories across regions, enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring that products are available when and where they are needed.
