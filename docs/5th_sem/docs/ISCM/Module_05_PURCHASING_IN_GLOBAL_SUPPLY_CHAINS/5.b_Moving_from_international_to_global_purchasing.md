# Moving from International to Global Purchasing

**International** and **Global** purchasing are related concepts but differ in scope and reach. Understanding this distinction is crucial for companies aiming to expand their procurement strategies.

## International vs. Global Purchasing

- **International Purchasing**: Involves sourcing products and services from two or more countries. It’s typically focused on meeting specific foreign needs or establishing connections with suppliers in a limited number of countries. **International** generally means "foreign" or "multinational," often reflecting a narrower scope in procurement practices.
  
- **Global Purchasing**: Encompasses procurement activities that span across the entire world, without limitations to specific regions or countries. It’s broader and aims to establish a truly **global** network, allowing access to suppliers worldwide. This all-encompassing approach supports companies in achieving higher efficiency, better risk management, and competitive advantages by tapping into global resources.

## Key Differences

While **International** and **Global** purchasing are sometimes used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings:

- **Scope**: *International* involves fewer countries, while *Global* includes a worldwide approach.
- **Objective**: *International* purchasing may focus on sourcing from specific countries, whereas *Global* purchasing seeks to leverage resources from all around the world.
- **Strategy**: Moving to a *Global* approach involves integrating global supplier networks, advanced technology, and comprehensive risk management across multiple regions.

## Transitioning from International to Global Purchasing

Transitioning from an **International** to a **Global** purchasing strategy is a key step for companies seeking to maximize the benefits of a worldwide supply chain. This shift often requires:

- Expanding the supplier base across more diverse and geographically varied regions.
- Leveraging technology to manage a global network effectively.
- Strengthening risk management strategies to account for a broader range of geopolitical and economic factors.
- Adopting a unified, worldwide approach to purchasing that aligns with a globalized economy.

This move allows businesses to access a wider pool of suppliers, improve cost efficiencies, and increase supply chain resilience by mitigating regional risks.
