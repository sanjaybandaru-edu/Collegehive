# International Commercial Terms (Incoterms)

## 1. Overview of Freight Incoterms

- Freight Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) are standardized terms used in sales contracts for importing and exporting goods.
- They define the responsibility and liability for goods throughout the shipment process.
- Incoterms specify when responsibility for the goods transfers from the supplier to the buyer and who bears the costs associated with the goods and their transport.

- **FAS (Free Alongside Ship)**: Seller delivers goods alongside a ship at the port; risk transfers to the buyer once goods are alongside the ship.
- **FOB (Free On Board)**: Seller loads goods onto a vessel at the port; risk transfers to the buyer once the goods are on board.
- **CFR (Cost And Freight)**: Seller covers costs to transport goods to the destination port, but risk transfers to the buyer once goods are on board at the origin port.
