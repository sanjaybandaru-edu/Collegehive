# 7.c Perceptual mapping in retail branding

Perceptual mapping is a visual tool used by retailers to understand how consumers perceive different brands or products in the market. By creating a “map” based on various attributes, retailers can better position their brand and make strategic decisions about marketing, pricing, and product development.

## 1. **What is Perceptual Mapping?**
   - **Definition**: Perceptual mapping involves plotting brands or products on a graph based on attributes like price, quality, style, or other relevant factors.
   - **Purpose**: This helps retailers see how their brand is positioned relative to competitors, revealing gaps or opportunities in the market.
   - **Example**: A perceptual map for clothing retailers might place “luxury brands” on one end of the spectrum and “affordable brands” on the other, based on perceived quality and price.

## 2. **Key Components of a Perceptual Map**
   - **Attributes**: Characteristics that define customer perceptions, such as price, quality, innovativeness, or sustainability.
   - **Dimensions**: Two or more scales that represent attributes important to consumers; common dimensions include “price vs. quality” or “fashion-forward vs. classic.”
   - **Customer Perceptions**: The relative placement of each brand on the map represents how customers perceive the brand’s attributes.

## 3. **Benefits of Perceptual Mapping**
   - **Competitive Insight**: Shows how a brand is positioned relative to competitors, helping identify areas for differentiation.
   - **Market Gaps**: Reveals unoccupied spaces where there may be an opportunity for new products or branding strategies.
   - **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Supports data-driven decisions for pricing, marketing, and product development by aligning offerings with customer expectations.

## 4. **Applications in Retail Branding**
   - **Product Positioning**: Retailers can adjust pricing, quality, and features based on where they want their brand to fit on the map.
   - **Rebranding Strategies**: Helps retailers shift consumer perceptions by seeing where they currently stand and where they want to move on the map.
   - **Target Audience Alignment**: By understanding what matters to customers (e.g., eco-friendliness, affordability), retailers can adjust brand messaging and offerings to meet specific expectations.

## 5. **Example of Perceptual Mapping in Action**
   - **Luxury vs. Value Retailers**: A perceptual map comparing luxury and budget-friendly brands might have “luxury” at the top and “value” at the bottom. A retailer that identifies in the “value” quadrant might choose to focus on quality improvements to capture a new market segment looking for affordable luxury.
