# 4.b Assortment planning process

Assortment planning is essential for aligning a retailer's product selection with customer demand, optimizing inventory, and enhancing sales. Here’s a breakdown of the main steps in the assortment planning process.

---

## 1. **Sales Forecasting**
   - **Purpose**: Predict the demand for a product category, ensuring the assortment meets expected sales.
   - **How**: Use past sales data, trend analysis, and market research to estimate customer demand.
   - **Example**: If sales for a specific style of jeans have consistently risen in recent years, forecasted sales may indicate higher inventory needs for that category.

## 2. **Define Variety and Assortment Depth**
   - **Variety (Breadth)**: The number of product types or categories offered.
   - **Depth**: The number of SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) within each product type.
   - **Goal**: Balance variety and depth to satisfy customer preferences while managing inventory costs.
   - **Example**: A retailer might offer a broad variety of electronics but focus deeply on high-demand items like smartphones.

## 3. **Editing the Assortment**
   - **Purpose**: Refine the assortment to match the retailer’s strategy, space, and customer preferences.
   - **Considerations**:
      - **Retail Strategy**: Align product mix with brand identity.
      - **GMROI Impact**: Ensure high return on inventory investments.
      - **Complementary Products**: Include items that boost sales in other categories.
      - **Store Layout**: Consider how much space is available for each category.
## 4. **Model Stock Plan**
   - **Purpose**: Define the ideal number of units for each SKU in each store.
   - **Goal**: Minimize out-of-stock issues while avoiding overstock.
   - **Example**: A store might stock a basic number of jeans in various sizes but increase quantities for more popular sizes based on historical sales.

## 5. **Setting Inventory Levels and Product Availability**
   - **Backup Stock**: Extra stock kept to ensure availability and avoid stockouts.
   - **Product Availability**: The percentage of demand met without running out of stock.
   - **Goal**: Optimize availability levels to balance customer satisfaction with cost efficiency

The assortment planning process helps retailers achieve a profitable, customer-centric product mix. Through careful forecasting, SKU selection, and inventory management, retailers can meet customer needs while optimizing costs and improving sales performance.
