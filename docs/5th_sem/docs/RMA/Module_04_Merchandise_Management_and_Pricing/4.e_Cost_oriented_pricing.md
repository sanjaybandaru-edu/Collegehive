# 4.e Cost oriented

Cost-oriented pricing is a straightforward approach in retail, where prices are set based on the cost of merchandise plus a markup to achieve profitability. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process and key concepts.

## 1. **Setting Prices Based on Costs**
   - **Basic Principle**: The retail price is determined by adding a markup to the cost of goods.
   - **Formula**: 
     ```
     Retail Price = Cost of Merchandise + Markup
     ```
   - **Example**: If a retailer buys a tennis racket for $75 and marks it up by $50, the retail price is set at $125.

## 2. **Markup**
   - **Definition**: The difference between the retail price and the cost of the item.
   - **Purpose**: The markup covers operating expenses (like rent, utilities, and wages) and ensures a profit.
   - **Calculation**:
     - **Markup Percentage**: Markup as a percentage of the retail price.
       ```
       Markup Percentage = (Markup / Retail Price) x 100
       ```
     - **Example**: For a $125 tennis racket with a $50 markup:
       ```
       Markup Percentage = ($50 / $125) x 100 = 40%
       ```

## 3. **Keystoning**
   - **Definition**: A common cost-based pricing approach where the retail price is set at double the cost of the item.
   - **Application**: Used to quickly set initial prices and ensure profitability.
   - **Example**: If a retailer buys a jacket for $40, using keystoning, the retail price would be:
     ```
     Retail Price = $40 x 2 = $80
     ```

## 4. **Initial Markup vs. Maintained Markup**
   - **Initial Markup**: The markup based on the original selling price set by the retailer.
   - **Maintained Markup**: The actual markup realized after deductions for markdowns, discounts, or shrinkage (inventory loss).
   - **Importance**: Differences between initial and maintained markups impact final profitability due to promotional activities or inventory losses.

## 5. **Break-Even Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Determines the sales volume needed to cover costs.
   - **Formula**:
     ```
     Break-Even Quantity = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)
     ```
   - **Example**: If fixed costs are $10,000, the selling price per unit is $50, and the variable cost per unit is $30:
     ```
     Break-Even Quantity = $10,000 / ($50 - $30) = 500 units
     ```
   - **Application**: Useful for ensuring that all costs are covered before setting profit goals.

## Conclusion

Cost-oriented pricing enables retailers to set prices that meet operating expenses while targeting profitability. With calculations like markup, keystoning, and break-even analysis, retailers can set cost-based prices effectively and strategically.
