Choosing the right retail location is crucial for a retailer’s success. The location influences foot traffic, sales, and overall profitability. Different types of retail locations each offer unique benefits and challenges. Understanding these options is key to making strategic decisions that align with the retailer's business objectives.

## 1. Types of Retail Locations
