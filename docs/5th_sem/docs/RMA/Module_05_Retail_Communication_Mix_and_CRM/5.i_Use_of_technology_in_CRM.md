## 1. **Identifying Target Customers**

   - **Purpose**: CRM begins with identifying the customers who provide the highest value to the retailer.
   - **Methods**:
     - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Evaluates a customer’s projected contribution to the retailer’s profit over their relationship with the store. High CLV customers are often prioritized for loyalty and retention strategies.
     - **Segmentation**:
       - **Behavior-Based Segmentation**: Groups customers based on purchase behavior, such as frequency and type of products bought.
       - **Demographic and Psychographic Data**: Incorporates customer demographics, interests, and values to develop detailed customer profiles for more targeted marketing.
     - **Example**: A retailer might identify a segment of health-focused, high-spending customers and target them with relevant wellness products.

## 2. **Developing and Implementing CRM Programs**

   - **Program Development**:
     - **Loyalty Programs**: Retailers implement loyalty or frequent-shopper programs to build customer loyalty. These programs reward customers for repeat purchases, fostering a sense of exclusivity and belonging.
     - **Customer Pyramid**:
       - **Platinum**: Highest-value customers who are the most loyal.
       - **Gold**: Valuable customers, though not as loyal as platinum.
       - **Iron**: Moderate spenders, targeted with periodic incentives.
       - **Lead**: Least profitable and often costly customers.
   - **Program Elements**:
     - **Tiered Rewards**: Loyalty programs often include tiered rewards, such as VIP benefits for high-tier members.
     - **Personalization**: Retailers customize offers, discounts, or exclusive access based on individual customer behavior to enhance engagement.
   - **Example**: Sephora’s Beauty Insider program offers rewards tiers like Rouge, VIB, and Insider, with perks scaling up for the most engaged members.

## 3. **Use of Technology in CRM**

   - **Data Warehousing**: Retailers use data warehouses to store and organize vast amounts of customer data, including transaction history, interactions, preferences, and demographics. This organized data enables more precise customer insights.
   - **Retail Analytics**:
     - **Market Basket Analysis**: Identifies products frequently bought together, allowing retailers to suggest add-ons and create bundle promotions.
     - **RFID Technology**: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) helps track products and customer interactions in-store, providing insights into shopping behaviors and preferences.
   - **Digital Loyalty Programs**:
     - **Mobile Apps**: Many retailers offer loyalty apps that let customers track rewards, view personalized offers, and receive real-time notifications.
     - **Cookies and Online Tracking**: Used to understand customer behavior on websites and customize online shopping experiences. This data helps inform CRM strategies and personalization.
