     - **Descriptive Information**: Demographic and psychographic details for effective customer segmentation.

## 2. **Identifying Customers**
   - **Challenges**: Identifying customers who make in-store purchases without providing personal information, especially when they use cash or third-party credit cards.
   - **Solutions**:
     - **Requesting Information**: Sales associates ask for contact details at checkout to link transactions with customer profiles.
