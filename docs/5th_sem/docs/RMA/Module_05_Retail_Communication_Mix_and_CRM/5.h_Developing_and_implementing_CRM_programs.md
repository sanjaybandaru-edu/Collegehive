Effectively identifying target customers and developing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programs are key steps in creating customer loyalty and maximizing lifetime value. Here’s an overview of the processes involved in targeting and managing customer relationships in retail.

## Identifying Target Customers

Retailers analyze customer data to identify the segments that are most valuable or show the highest potential. This helps in focusing resources on customers who are likely to drive the greatest profit.

### 1. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
   - **Definition**: CLV is the projected profit that a customer will bring over the duration of their relationship with the retailer.
   - **Purpose**: CLV helps retailers prioritize high-value customers who are more likely to bring sustained profits.
   - **Example**: A retailer might compare customers’ purchase frequency and volume, identifying those who buy frequently as high CLV customers.

### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
   - **Methods**:
     - **Benefit Segmentation**: Grouping customers by the benefits they seek, such as quality or affordability.
     - **Composite Segmentation**: Using a mix of demographics, lifestyle, and benefits sought to create detailed customer profiles.
   - **Example**: CVS uses segmentation profiles like “Vanessa,” a high-spending mom, to tailor offerings to specific customer needs.

### 3. **The 80-20 Rule**
   - **Definition**: This rule suggests that 80% of sales often come from 20% of customers, helping focus on high-value customer segments.
   - **Application**: By identifying this top segment, retailers can tailor their loyalty programs and rewards specifically to these high-value customers.

## Developing and Implementing CRM Programs

CRM programs use data-driven strategies to foster loyalty and increase sales by focusing on customer preferences and behaviors. The CRM process typically includes data collection, program development, and ongoing engagement with targeted customers.

### 1. **Frequent-Shopper Programs**
   - **Purpose**: Encourage repeat purchases and reward loyal customers.
   - **Features for Effectiveness**:
     - **Tiered Rewards**: Offer different levels of rewards based on customer spending.
     - **VIP Experiences**: Provide high-tier customers with exclusive benefits.
     - **Transparency**: Simple, clear reward structures that customers can easily track and understand.

### 2. **Customer Pyramid for CRM**
   - **Customer Segmentation**: Organizing customers into tiers based on CLV:
     - **Platinum**: Most valuable and loyal customers, less price-sensitive.
     - **Gold**: High-value but more price-sensitive, needing incentives for loyalty.
     - **Iron**: Regular customers with moderate loyalty.
     - **Lead**: Low-value customers who may require fewer resources.

### 3. **Personalization in CRM**
   - **1-to-1 Retailing**: Creating personalized offers and recommendations based on customer history.
   - **Community Building**: Fostering a community of loyal customers who feel connected to the brand, which can increase engagement and repeat purchases.

## CRM Program Implementation

After developing CRM strategies, implementation focuses on sustaining and expanding customer relationships.

### 1. **Data-Driven Customization**
   - **Targeted Promotions**: Using CRM data to customize offers based on customer purchase history.
   - **Market Basket Analysis**: Identifying frequently bought items to suggest complementary products and create bundled offers.

### 2. **Customer Retention Approaches**
   - **Personalized Services**: Upscale retailers often provide exclusive services (e.g., private shopping events) to high-value customers.
   - **Community Engagement**: Encouraging interactions through customer events, social media, and feedback programs to create a sense of brand community.
