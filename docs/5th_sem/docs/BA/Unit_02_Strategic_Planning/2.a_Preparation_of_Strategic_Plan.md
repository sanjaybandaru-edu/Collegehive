# What is Strategic Analysis?

**Strategic Analysis** is a crucial process that involves collecting and analyzing data to help business leaders make informed decisions about their company's future. It helps in setting clear priorities and goals, shaping a long-term strategy that aligns with the company’s mission and market environment. This process is fundamental because it provides insights into both the internal workings of the company and the external market forces that could impact its success.

## Importance of Strategic Analysis

Strategic analysis is essential for any organization because it forms the foundation upon which strategies are built. By understanding the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, leaders can make better decisions that position the company for growth and success. This analysis helps companies anticipate changes in the market, identify new opportunities, and mitigate potential risks.

## Common Methods of Strategic Analysis

Two widely used methods in strategic analysis are **SWOT** and **PESTLE** analyses.

### 1. **SWOT Analysis**
**SWOT Analysis** stands for **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats**. This method helps a company identify where it excels (Strengths), where it needs improvement (Weaknesses), potential areas for growth (Opportunities), and external factors that could hinder its success (Threats). 

- **Example:** Let’s say you own a chain of organic grocery stores. Through a SWOT analysis, you might discover that your Strength is a strong brand reputation for quality products. Your Weakness could be a lack of online presence. An Opportunity might be the growing demand for home delivery services, while a Threat could be increasing competition from large supermarkets. This analysis can guide you in enhancing your online platform to capture the opportunity and better compete in the market.

### 2. **PESTLE Analysis**
**PESTLE Analysis** focuses on external factors that influence a business. These include **Political**, **Economic**, **Social**, **Technological**, **Legal**, and **Environmental** factors. Unlike SWOT, which considers internal and external factors, PESTLE is entirely focused on external influences that are outside the company’s control but crucial to its strategy.

- **Example:** If you run a renewable energy company, a PESTLE analysis might reveal that new government regulations (Political) are favoring renewable energy subsidies, which could boost your business. However, economic downturns (Economic) might reduce consumer spending, affecting sales. Understanding these factors helps you prepare your business strategy accordingly, perhaps by lobbying for favorable policies or adjusting your pricing strategy during tough economic times.

## The Strategic Analysis Process: 5 Key Steps

Here’s a step-by-step guide to conducting an effective strategic analysis:

### 1. **Determine the Scope**
First, decide the level at which you are conducting the analysis. Are you looking at the entire company, a specific division, or just a particular function like marketing or sales? Understanding this scope helps in targeting the analysis effectively.

- **Example:** If you’re a multinational company, you might conduct a strategic analysis for each regional division separately, as market dynamics can vary significantly across regions.

### 2. **Assemble a Diverse Team**
Bring together a team that includes people from different parts of the company, such as leadership, finance, HR, operations, and sales. This diverse input ensures that you consider all angles of the business.

- **Example:** If you’re analyzing a new product launch, include representatives from product development, marketing, finance, and customer service to get a comprehensive view.

### 3. **Conduct the Analysis**
Use methods like SWOT or PESTLE to gather and analyze relevant data. Encourage team members to bring both quantitative (numbers, statistics) and qualitative (opinions, feedback) data. You might also include feedback from customers or industry experts.

- **Example:** A software company might use SWOT analysis to identify its strong customer support as a Strength, and PESTLE analysis to understand how new data privacy laws (Legal factor) might impact its operations.

### 4. **Summarize and Present Findings**
After gathering the data, summarize your findings in a clear, visually appealing report. This report should highlight the key conclusions from the analysis and provide context for these insights. Effective presentation helps in getting buy-in from stakeholders.

- **Example:** Presenting your findings to the executive team might include a visual SWOT matrix, highlighting how your company can leverage its strengths to seize market opportunities.

### 5. **Develop a Strategic Plan**
Finally, use the analysis to craft a strategic plan. This plan should set clear priorities, goals, and the steps needed to achieve them. It should also address how the company will use its strengths, address weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and mitigate threats.

- **Example:** Based on the earlier SWOT analysis for the organic grocery store chain, the strategic plan might include launching an online shopping platform, marketing campaigns focused on your brand’s quality, and strategies to outmaneuver competitors.

## Practical Example in Context

Imagine you run a mid-sized tech company specializing in cloud storage solutions. You want to ensure the company’s growth over the next five years. Here’s how you might use strategic analysis:

- **SWOT Analysis:** You identify that your **Strength** is having cutting-edge encryption technology, but your **Weakness** is limited brand recognition. An **Opportunity** is the increasing demand for secure data storage due to rising cyber threats. A **Threat** is the potential entry of tech giants into your niche market.

- **PESTLE Analysis:** Politically, new data protection regulations are being enacted globally, which could boost demand for your secure storage solutions. Economically, a recession might reduce overall IT spending, but companies may still prioritize data security.

Using these insights, you develop a strategy that focuses on aggressive branding and marketing to increase visibility, while also lobbying for favorable regulations and exploring partnerships to expand your customer base.
