# 3.a Consumer Motivation

Motivation is the driving force that impels people to act. It represents the reasons one has for acting or behaving in a particular way. Needs are circumstances or things that that are wanted or required, and they direct the motivational forces.
Human beingsâ€™ most basic needs are biological and fulfilling them sustains physical existence and safety.



Motivation is a key factor in consumer behavior, driven by the psychological tension that arises from unfulfilled needs. To alleviate this tension, consumers consciously and subconsciously set goals and choose actions they believe will satisfy their needs. Whether they achieve satisfaction depends on the effectiveness of their chosen actions. Personality traits influence the goals consumers set and the paths they take to achieve them.

In marketing, the focus is on identifying and fulfilling consumer needs rather than creating them. Marketers often help consumers recognize dormant needs, but they do not invent these needs. Successful companies define their business by the needs they satisfy, which allows them to stay relevant by developing products that meet these needs. This approach helps them remain competitive and resilient, even in challenging economic environments. On the other hand, companies that focus narrowly on the products they produce risk obsolescence when competitors introduce offerings that better meet consumer needs. By prioritizing the satisfaction of needs over the production of specific products, companies can ensure long-term success and growth.
