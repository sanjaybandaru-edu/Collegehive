# 3.c Perception


Perception in consumer behavior is about how individuals subjectively interpret and understand the world around them, rather than the objective reality of things. This subjective understanding is deeply ingrained and difficult to change, as illustrated by the case of Science Diet. 

EXAMPLE: 
For years, Science Diet was a leading pet food brand, positioned as a scientifically-engineered product with specialized ingredients. However, as consumer preferences shifted towards natural and organic pet foods, the brand's engineered nutrition claims became a liability. Even when the company introduced Science Diet Nature’s Best, featuring natural ingredients like lamb and brown rice, it struggled to change consumer perceptions that the brand was artificial and unnatural. This example highlights the challenge of altering consumers' ingrained perceptions.


1. Perception is not merely the result of raw sensory input but rather the product of how individuals process and interpret these inputs. Human beings are constantly exposed to an overwhelming number of stimuli. 
However, instead of being overwhelmed, people subconsciously filter out and adapt to most of these stimuli, preventing sensory overload.
2. This process of perception involves two key types of input: physical stimuli from the external environment and internal factors such as expectations, motives, and past experiences. The interaction between these external and internal inputs creates a unique and personal view of the world for each individual.

Because each person has a distinct set of experiences, needs, and expectations, their perceptions of the world are also unique. This explains why different people can perceive the same stimulus in very different ways. For instance, two consumers might see the same advertisement but interpret its message differently based on their personal experiences and expectations.

Perception consists of three key processes: selection, organization, and interpretation of stimuli. 

1. **Selection of Stimuli:** Individuals are selective in what they notice. They filter out most stimuli and only recognize those that stand out to them based on their current needs, interests, and environment.

2. **Organization of Stimuli:** Once a stimulus is recognized, people subconsciously organize it according to common psychological principles, such as grouping similar items together or filling in gaps in information.

3. **Interpretation of Stimuli:** Finally, individuals interpret these organized stimuli based on their personal experiences, motives, and expectations. This subjective interpretation gives meaning to the stimuli and shapes how individuals perceive and react to the world around them.

**Sensory Input and Sensation**  
Sensation is the immediate and direct response of the sensory organs to stimuli, which are any inputs to the senses, such as products, packages, brand names, advertisements, and commercials. Sensory receptors, including the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin, are responsible for receiving these inputs and enabling the senses to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. These sensory functions play a crucial role in the purchase, use, and evaluation of consumer products. Sensitivity to stimuli varies among individuals based on the quality of their sensory receptors and the intensity of the stimuli they encounter. For example, a person with impaired vision might have an enhanced sense of hearing, allowing them to detect sounds that others might not notice.

**The Role of Sensory Input in Perception**  
Sensation depends on energy changes within the environment where perception occurs. In a highly stimulating environment, such as a busy city street, individuals become desensitized to certain stimuli, like honking horns, because these sounds are so common. Conversely, in quieter environments, people are more sensitive to changes in sensory input, such as the sound of a pin dropping. This adaptability allows humans to detect subtle stimuli when needed and to protect themselves from being overwhelmed by excessive sensory input.

**Importance of Different Senses in Marketing**  
While sight and sound are the primary senses targeted by most marketing communications, smell and touch are also powerful tools for engaging consumers. The sense of smell, for example, is closely linked to memory, as demonstrated by the work of Nobel Prize-winning scientists. Marketers have utilized this by incorporating scents into advertisements and retail environments. For instance, scented strips are commonly used in perfume ads, and coffee-scented stickers have been placed on newspapers to attract attention. Retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch use strong fragrances throughout their stores to enhance the shopping experience, making time spent in the store feel shorter and more enjoyable for customers.

**Touch and Its Influence on Consumer Behavior**  
The sense of touch also significantly influences consumer behavior. Studies have shown that touching a product can increase persuasion and enhance a consumer's likelihood of purchasing. For example, during economic downturns, retailers like Dollar General and Best Buy have increased the sensory input by adding more merchandise to their shelves, thereby encouraging consumers to spend more time in their stores and increasing the chances of purchase.

**Sound as a Marketing Tool**  
Sound, like visuals, can convey powerful messages and influence consumer perception. Many companies invest significant resources in designing products and packaging that emit specific audio cues. These sounds are carefully studied to match consumer preferences regarding volume and pitch, thereby enhancing the overall sensory experience and making the product more appealing.

Sensory input is a critical element in consumer behavior, influencing how products are perceived and experienced. Marketers leverage the senses—sight, sound, smell, and touch—to create compelling and memorable consumer experiences. By understanding how sensory inputs interact with consumer perceptions, businesses can develop more effective marketing strategies that resonate with their target audience and drive purchasing decisions.


 Subliminal Perception in Consumer Behavior**

**Definition and Concept**  
Subliminal perception refers to the process by which people perceive stimuli that are below their level of conscious awareness. These stimuli are too weak or brief to be consciously seen or heard but are still strong enough to be detected by the sensory receptors. The term "subliminal" means that the stimulus is below the threshold of conscious awareness, though not below the absolute threshold of the sensory receptors involved.

**Historical Context and Initial Claims**  
The concept of subliminal advertising was famously tested in 1957 at a drive-in movie theater in New Jersey, where phrases like "Eat popcorn" and "Drink Coca-Cola" were flashed on the screen too quickly for viewers to consciously notice. It was reported that these subliminal messages led to significant increases in popcorn and Coca-Cola sales—58% and 18% respectively. However, these findings were later revealed to be fabricated. Subsequent studies, including one that showed the subliminal word "COKE" could arouse thirst but did not lead to actual behavior change, further debunked the effectiveness of subliminal commands in influencing consumer behavior.

**Research Findings and Limitations**  
Despite numerous studies on subliminal persuasion, there is no credible evidence that subliminal advertising can persuade people to buy goods or services. Research indicates that subliminal perception has no significant effect on attitudes toward products or consumption behavior, and many of the observed effects occurred in highly artificial settings. For instance, a laboratory study exposed participants to subliminal images of the Apple and IBM logos and found that those exposed to the Apple logo scored higher on a creativity test. However, this was interpreted as a possible trigger of certain associations or motivations rather than a direct influence on behavior.

**Skepticism and Misconceptions**  
Over the years, there have been reports of subliminal messages being used in various media to influence consumer behavior, such as the accusations against Disney movies like "Aladdin" and "The Lion King" for allegedly containing subliminal messages. However, scientific testing of these claims has generally not supported the notion that subliminal messages can significantly influence consumer behavior. Most researchers agree that subliminal advertising is largely ineffective and that what people perceive as subliminal messages often results from vivid imaginations interpreting ambiguous stimuli.

**Subliminal Perception and Consumer Behavior**  
The broader conclusion drawn from research on subliminal perception is that individuals tend to see what they want to see or expect to see, which aligns with the general principles of perception in consumer behavior. While subliminal stimuli may trigger certain associations or thoughts, they do not reliably lead to specific behaviors or actions. The idea that subliminal messages can subtly manipulate consumers to act in certain ways remains largely unsupported by credible scientific evidence.

Subliminal perception is a fascinating concept, but its influence on consumer behavior is minimal at best. Despite early claims and ongoing myths, the scientific consensus is that subliminal advertising does not effectively persuade consumers to buy products or engage in specific behaviors. Instead, what people perceive is often shaped by their expectations and imaginations, rather than by any hidden or subliminal messages.

Physical stimuli that influence consumer perceptions and attract attention include the product's attributes, packaging, brand name, advertisements, and promotional placements. Ads that contrast with their surroundings—such as using dramatic imagery against a plain background, starting a commercial with silence, or placing ads in unexpected locations—are more likely to stand out and capture consumer attention.

Perception is the process by which individuals select, organize, and interpret sensory information to create a meaningful picture of the world. It involves several stages:

1. **Selection of Stimuli:**  
   Perception begins with the selection of stimuli. Individuals are constantly bombarded with sensory inputs, but they selectively focus on certain stimuli based on factors like personal relevance, interest, or novelty. This process is influenced by individual needs, experiences, and expectations.

2. **Organization of Stimuli:**  
   Once a stimulus is selected, the brain organizes it into a coherent structure. This organization often follows common psychological principles, such as grouping similar items together, recognizing patterns, or filling in gaps based on past experiences.

3. **Interpretation of Stimuli:**  
   After organizing the stimuli, individuals interpret them to assign meaning. Interpretation is highly subjective and influenced by factors like cultural background, personal experiences, motives, and expectations. Different people may interpret the same stimulus in different ways based on their unique perspectives.

4. **Influence of Expectations and Experience:**  
   Expectations, built from past experiences, play a significant role in perception. They shape how stimuli are perceived and can lead to biases in interpretation. For example, if a consumer expects a luxury brand to offer high quality, they are more likely to perceive a product from that brand as superior, even if it's similar to lower-priced alternatives.

5. **Perceptual Distortion:**  
   Perception is not always an accurate reflection of reality. It can be distorted by factors such as emotions, motives, and psychological biases, leading individuals to perceive things in ways that may not align with objective reality.
