# 5.b Family Decision Making

### Family Decision-Making Patterns

Family decision-making involves multiple members contributing based on product type, family roles, and cultural norms. Key decision-making types include:

1. **Husband-Dominated Decisions**: Husbands typically decide on financial, tech, or car purchases in traditional or specific cultural settings.
  
2. **Wife-Dominated Decisions**: Wives often influence household items, food, and children’s clothing purchases due to their role in managing daily home needs.

3. **Joint Decisions**: Spouses collaborate on significant purchases like homes, cars, and vacations, especially in dual-income households.

4. **Autonomic Decisions**: Either spouse independently decides on personal or smaller purchases, such as clothing or personal care items.

### Children’s Role in Family Decision-Making

Children’s influence has grown due to smaller family sizes and a child-centric culture. They impact purchases directly related to them (toys, snacks, etc.) and use tactics like:

- **Pressure**: Persistent requests.
- **Exchange**: Offering behavior or chores in return.
- **Consultation**: Asking for input to involve parents.

Children often influence decisions in categories like vacations, meals, and technology purchases.

### Consumption-Related Roles in Families

Each family member plays specific roles in the purchase process:

- **Influencers**: Often children or teens, they suggest preferences that impact final decisions.
- **Gatekeepers**: Control information flow, limiting exposure to certain products (usually parents).
- **Deciders**: Make the final choice, typically parents for major purchases.
- **Buyers**: The person completing the transaction, often parents.
- **Preparers**: Prepare items for use, like assembling toys or setting up devices (often parents).
- **Users**: Family members who consume the product.
- **Maintainers**: Handle upkeep or repairs to ensure continued product usability.
- **Disposers**: Decide when to replace or dispose of items.

### Marketing Implications

1. **Targeted Marketing**: Tailor messages to resonate with the primary decision-makers, e.g., appealing to both parents and children for vacation spots.

2. **Product Positioning**: Position big-ticket items to appeal to both spouses; focus on quality for household goods to satisfy both buyers and users.

3. **Influence Tactics**: Recognize and leverage children’s influence tactics in marketing kid-centric products, balancing appeal to both children and parents. 

These insights help marketers understand family dynamics and better position products to meet various family needs and decision roles.
