# 4.a Influence of Culture on Consumer Behavior

Culture is the collective values, customs, norms, arts, social  institutions, and intellectual achievements of a particular society. Cultural values express the collective principles, standards, and priorities of a community. Most of the promotional 
messages across the world reflect, to some degree, the target audiences’ cultural values.

Researchers have conceptualized cultural norms at three levels:

1. Supranational level: Underlying cultural dimensions that span across national or cultural boundaries, such as regional characteristics, racial, religious similarities, or shared languages.
2. National level: Core values, customs, and personalities that define a country's "national character."
3. **Group level**: Subdivisions within a society, such as subcultures and reference groups.

At the supranational level, researchers identified four global youth segments (ages 14-24):

1. In-crowd: Focused on privilege and tradition, seeking approval through classic brands like Nike.
2. Pop Mavericks: Value individuality and personalization, favoring brands like Diesel and Adidas.
3. Networked Intelligentsia: Online creatives, drawn to cult brands like Vespa and Vans.
4. Thrill Renegades: Seek adrenaline and rebellion, rejecting conventional law and order.

Culture helps fulfill consumer needs by offering clear guidelines for daily decisions. It sets norms for:

- **Eating habits**: When and where to eat, and what foods are suitable for different meals and occasions (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, picnics, or weddings).
- **Perception of products**: Culture influences whether products are seen as necessities (e.g., mobile phones) or luxuries, evolving with societal trends.
- **Dress codes**: Specifies what to wear for various situations, such as at home, work, or social gatherings.


Certainly! Here's an elaboration on the key points:

### 1. **Forms of Cultural Learning**:
   Cultural learning happens in three main ways:

   - **Formal learning**: This is when cultural norms and behaviors are explicitly taught by family members, especially parents or older siblings. These lessons can include manners, values, and socially accepted behaviors. For instance, parents may teach children how to behave in social settings, the importance of honesty, or how to respect others.

   - **Informal learning**: Occurs when individuals, particularly children, learn by observing and imitating others. This can include mimicking the behaviors of family members, friends, or even media figures (such as TV or movie characters). For example, a child may imitate their favorite character’s behavior or style, or pick up habits from peers in school.

   - **Technical learning**: This type of learning happens in formal educational settings where teachers provide structured knowledge. It involves instruction on societal norms, practical skills, and values that are relevant both in social and personal contexts. For instance, children are taught in school not only academic subjects but also civic responsibilities and how to interact in society.

### 2. **Enculturation vs. Acculturation**:
   - **Enculturation**: This is the process by which individuals learn the culture of their own society. From a young age, children absorb the values, norms, and customs that are dominant within their own culture, typically through family, education, and social interactions. Enculturation forms the basis of an individual's cultural identity.

   - **Acculturation**: Refers to the process of learning and adapting to a new or foreign culture. This is particularly important for immigrants, expatriates, or even tourists who need to understand and navigate a culture different from their own. In marketing, acculturation becomes crucial when companies expand to international markets, as they need to understand local customs, preferences, and values to effectively promote their products.

### 3. **Cultural Transmission Through Family, Education, and Religion**:
   - **Family**: The family unit plays a foundational role in teaching cultural values and consumption-related skills. For example, children learn about the meaning of money, preferences for certain brands, and how to assess product quality through family practices and discussions.

   - **Educational institutions**: Schools teach not only academic content but also cultural values. They impart knowledge about arts, sciences, and civics, and prepare students with the specialized skills needed for professional life. Schools also play a role in shaping social norms, such as teamwork, responsibility, and leadership.

   - **Religious institutions**: These offer spiritual and moral guidance that often influences behavior. Religious teachings can instill values such as kindness, honesty, responsibility, and respect for others. These moral lessons have a lasting impact on individuals’ personal and social lives.

### 4. **Marketing's Role in Cultural Learning**:
   - **Media and advertising**: Media is a powerful tool for reinforcing cultural values. Advertisements not only promote products but also reflect and transmit cultural ideals. For example, repeated exposure to ads emphasizing certain lifestyles, fashion trends, or consumer behaviors helps to shape societal expectations and norms. Over time, these messages influence consumer behavior, such as expectations for the latest smartphone features or preferences for certain brands.

   - **Nonverbal elements in ads**: Advertisements often use imagery, color schemes, music, and symbolism to convey cultural messages. These elements subtly communicate ideas about status, identity, and values. For instance, luxury brands may use sophisticated visuals to associate their products with wealth and success.

   - **Social media and virtual communities**: Social media platforms and online communities are becoming key spaces where cultural values are shared and reinforced. Users exchange opinions, trends, and preferences, further spreading cultural norms. For instance, influencers on platforms like Instagram or Twitter can shape fashion trends, eating habits, and even ethical stances (e.g., environmentalism, humanitarianism).

Marketing and advertising thus play a central role in reinforcing and shaping cultural beliefs by reflecting society’s values and promoting products that align with these values.
