# 4.b Characteristics and Measurement of Culture

Culture consists of shared values, norms, language, symbols, and rituals that guide behavior within a society. It influences how individuals and groups make decisions, shaping expectations and social roles. Key characteristics include:

1. **Collective Values and Norms**: Cultural norms set behavioral standards, defining what is considered appropriate within a society.
2. **Language, Symbols, and Rituals**: These elements help communicate cultural values, as seen in rituals like weddings or symbols like brand logos, which evoke shared meanings.
3. **Evolving Nature**: Culture adapts over time due to internal changes or external influences, such as technological advancements or globalization.

### Methods for Measuring Cultural Influence
A. **Content analysis** examines the content of verbal, written, and pictorial communications, such as promotional messages, across various fields (e.g., marketing, sociology, psychology). Key applications include:

1. **Identifying Communication Trends**: Analyzes intentions and focus in communications by individuals or groups.
2. **Describing Responses**: Reveals attitudinal and behavioral reactions to messaging.
3. **Determining Psychological States**: Assesses emotional or psychological states from communication content.

Content analysis is used to track social and cultural changes or to compare cultural portrayals. For example, a study of Seventeen Magazine ads found American teen girls depicted as independent, while Japanese ads showed girls as happy and playful. Another study revealed that 82% of ads aimed at Chinese children promoted food products, while 56% of U.S. ads for children focused on toys.

B. **Field observation** is a research method where anthropologists and marketers observe behaviors in natural settings to understand societal values, beliefs, and customs. Key points include:

1. **Natural Environment**: Observations occur in real-world settings (e.g., stores).
2. **Unaware Subjects**: Subjects typically don’t know they are being observed.
3. **Focus on Behavior**: Emphasis is on observing actions, not direct questioning.

Sometimes, researchers act as participant-observers, actively engaging in the environment to gain deeper insights. For example, Nissan researchers rented rooms in American homes to understand car preferences, revealing Americans’ preference for visible luxury over Japanese simplicity.

Field observation is often supplemented with depth interviews and focus groups to track cultural shifts and consumer expectations. For instance, focus groups have revealed that loyal customers expect personalized services, leading companies to develop loyalty programs.

Additionally, a study on symbolic meanings of foods identified seven types: symbolic (comfort foods), individual (healthy choices), social (family-shared foods), cultural (libido-enhancing), ritualistic (nostalgic), context (date-specific), and experience foods (unfamiliar cuisines).


C. **Value Measurement Tools**: Surveys like the Rokeach Value Survey and VALS quantify cultural values and segment consumers based on lifestyle and priorities.


### Rokeach Value Survey (RVS)
The Rokeach Value Survey is a psychological assessment tool that measures individual value orientations. It categorizes values into two main types:
1. **Terminal Values**: These are end-goals people aim to achieve, such as happiness, security, or a sense of accomplishment.
2. **Instrumental Values**: These are modes of behavior that help in achieving terminal values, like honesty, independence, or responsibility.

The survey helps marketers understand what consumers prioritize in life, which can guide messaging strategies and product positioning.

### VALS (Values and Lifestyles)
VALS is a psychographic segmentation tool that categorizes consumers based on their psychological traits and key demographics. It divides people into several lifestyle segments (e.g., Innovators, Thinkers, Achievers) based on their motivations and resources. VALS helps in targeting consumers more precisely by matching products and messages to the lifestyle preferences of specific segments, leading to more effective marketing strategies.

These tools allow companies to align marketing approaches with consumer values and motivations, enhancing resonance and engagement with target audiences.
