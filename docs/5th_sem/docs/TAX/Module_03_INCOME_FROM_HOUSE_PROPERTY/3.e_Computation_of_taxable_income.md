# 3.e Computation of taxable income

### Example Calculation
Suppose the Gross Annual Value (GAV) of a property is ₹3,00,000. Municipal taxes paid during the year amount to ₹30,000. The property owner is entitled to a deduction for interest on borrowed capital of ₹50,000.

1. **GAV** = ₹3,00,000
2. **Less: Municipal Taxes Paid** = ₹30,000
3. **Net Annual Value (NAV)** = ₹3,00,000 - ₹30,000 = ₹2,70,000
4. **Less: Standard Deduction (30% of NAV)** = 30% of ₹2,70,000 = ₹81,000
5. **Less: Interest on Borrowed Capital** = ₹50,000
6. **Taxable Income from House Property** = ₹2,70,000 - ₹81,000 - ₹50,000 = ₹1,39,000
