# 2.b Treatment of Various Allowances

## Understanding Allowances Under Section 10 of the Income Tax Act, 1961
Allowances are a fixed amount of cash or benefits regularly given to salaried employees in addition to their salary. These allowances are meant to cover specific needs related to the employee's service or to compensate for working under certain conditions. Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, certain allowances are exempt from taxation, either fully or partially, under Section 10. Understanding these allowances and their tax implications is essential for optimizing tax liabilities.

## Types of Allowances and Their Tax Treatment
Allowances can be categorized into three main types based on their tax treatment:

### 1. Taxable Allowances
### 2. Non-Taxable Allowances

Allowances under Section 10 of the Income Tax Act are designed to help employees meet specific expenses or compensate for working under certain conditions. Understanding which allowances are fully taxable, non-taxable, or partially taxable is essential for effective tax planning.

Taxable Allowances: Fully added to the income and taxed accordingly.

Non-Taxable Allowances: Fully exempt from tax.

Partially Taxable Allowances: Partially exempt, with the remainder being taxable based on specific limits and conditions.

## Entertainment Allowance covered under Section 16(ii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Entertainment Allowance is an allowance provided by employers to their employees to meet the expenses incurred on hospitality or entertainment of clients, guests, or official visitors. The tax treatment of entertainment allowance differs based on whether the employee is a government or non-government employee.

### Tax Treatment
#### For Government Employees:

The Entertainment Allowance is taxable, but government employees can claim a deduction under Section 16(ii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Deduction: The least of the following is allowed as a deduction:
20% of the basic salary (excluding other allowances, benefits, and perquisites).
Actual amount received as Entertainment Allowance.
₹5,000.
After this deduction, the remaining portion of the Entertainment Allowance, if any, is taxable.

#### For Non-Government Employees:

The entire amount received as Entertainment Allowance is fully taxable with no deduction available. Non-government employees cannot claim any deduction for this allowance, making it a part of their gross income.

## House rent Allowance (HRA) : Under section 10 (13 A), of Income Tax Act 1961.

House Rent Allowance (HRA) is an allowance provided by employers to employees as part of their salary to cover rental accommodation expenses. Under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, salaried employees living in rented accommodation can claim an exemption on the HRA they receive, which helps in reducing their taxable income. However, the exemption is subject to certain conditions and is only available to salaried individuals.

### Conditions for Claiming HRA Exemption
To claim HRA exemption, the following conditions must be met:

- Salaried Employees Only: The exemption is available only to salaried individuals who receive HRA as part of their salary. Self-employed individuals are not eligible for HRA exemption, but they can claim a deduction for rent paid under Section 80GG of the Income Tax Act.

- Rented Accommodation: The individual must be living in rented accommodation. If the individual owns the house in which they are living, they cannot claim HRA exemption.

- Rent Paid Exceeds 10% of Salary: The rent paid by the individual should exceed 10% of their salary (basic salary + dearness allowance).

- HRA is Part of Salary: The HRA component must be part of the individual's salary package. This can typically be seen in Form 16(B), Sr. No. 2(e).

- Not Paying Rent to Spouse: The individual cannot claim HRA exemption if they are paying rent to their spouse. However, paying rent to other family members (such as parents) is allowed, provided the family member owns the property and declares the rental income.

### How Much Deduction Can Be Taken?
The HRA exemption is calculated as the least of the following three amounts:

1. Actual HRA Received: The actual amount of HRA received from the employer during the financial year.

2. 50% of Salary (Basic + DA) for Metro Cities / 40% of Salary for Non-Metro Cities:

- Metro Cities: If the rented accommodation is in a metro city (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai), the exemption is 50% of the salary (Basic + Dearness Allowance).

- Non-Metro Cities: If the rented accommodation is in a non-metro city, the exemption is 40% of the salary (Basic + Dearness Allowance).

3. Actual Rent Paid Less 10% of Salary: The actual rent paid during the financial year minus 10% of the salary (Basic + Dearness Allowance).

The amount of HRA exemption is the least of these three values.

### 3. Example to Understand HRA Calculation
Let’s consider a few examples to understand how HRA exemption is calculated:

Example 1: Employee in a Metro City (e.g., Mumbai)

Basic Salary = ₹50,000 per month

Dearness Allowance (DA) = ₹10,000 per month

Actual HRA Received = ₹20,000 per month

Rent Paid = ₹25,000 per month

- Step 1: Calculate the HRA exemption:

Actual HRA received: ₹20,000 per month = ₹2,40,000 per year

50% of Salary (Basic + DA): 50% of ₹60,000 = ₹30,000 per month = ₹3,60,000 per year

Actual Rent Paid Less 10% of Salary: (₹25,000 - ₹6,000) per month = ₹19,000 per month = ₹2,28,000 per year

- HRA Exemption: The least of the above amounts:

₹2,40,000 (Actual HRA received)

₹3,60,000 (50% of Salary)

₹2,28,000 (Rent Paid - 10% of Salary)

- Exempted HRA: ₹2,28,000

Taxable HRA: ₹2,40,000 - ₹2,28,000 = ₹12,000
