# 1.g Capital and Revenue Expenditure

# Capital Expenditure vs. Revenue Expenditure - Under the Income Tax Act

Since the Income Tax Act does not explicitly define "capital expenditure" and "revenue expenditure," we must rely on their ordinary meanings and judicial interpretations. Below are some key distinctions:

## 1. Acquisition of Fixed Assets vs. Routine Expenses
- **Capital Expenditure**: Incurred to acquire, extend, or improve a fixed asset.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Incurred in the regular course of business as a routine operating expense.

## 2. Multiple Years vs. Single Year
- **Capital Expenditure**: Provides benefits over multiple years.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Consumed within a single year.

## 3. Improvement vs. Maintenance
- **Capital Expenditure**: Enhances the earning capacity of a business.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Maintains the profit-generating capacity of a business.

## 4. Non-Recurring vs. Recurring
- **Capital Expenditure**: Typically a non-recurring outlay.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Generally a recurring expense.

## 5. Lump Sum vs. Periodic Payments
- The method of payment (whether lump sum or periodic) does not necessarily determine if an expenditure is capital or revenue in nature.

## 6. Importance of Differentiation
When calculating taxable profits under the Income Tax Act, only revenue expenses are deductible. Hence, distinguishing between capital and revenue expenditure is crucial. The following criteria can be applied:

### (i) Nature of the Asset
- **Capital Expenditure**: Incurred to acquire or install a fixed asset.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Incurred for purchasing goods for resale and associated costs.

### (ii) Nature of Liability
- **Capital Expenditure**: Payments made to settle a capital liability.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Payments made to settle a revenue liability.

### (iii) Nature of the Transaction
- **Capital Expenditure**: Incurred to acquire a source of income (e.g., purchasing patents).
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Incurred to generate income (e.g., staff salaries, advertising costs).

### (iv) Purpose of the Transaction
- **Capital Expenditure**: Spent to enhance the earning capacity of an asset.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Spent to maintain an asset in working condition.

### (v) Nature of Payment in the Hands of the Payer
- **Capital Expenditure**: Remains capital expenditure even if it is revenue receipt for the receiver.
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Remains revenue expenditure even if it is capital receipt for the receiver.

## Revenue Expenditure [Section 35(1)(i)]
All revenue expenses related to scientific research during the previous year are fully deductible. Additionally, revenue expenses for scientific research incurred during the three years preceding the start of the business are deemed to be expenses of the previous year in which the business begins and are deductible in that year.

### Example
If a business begins on 15.12.2018, all revenue expenses related to scientific research incurred on or after that date will be deductible. Moreover, expenses incurred between 15.12.2015 and 14.12.2018, as certified by the prescribed authority, will be treated as expenses of the previous year 2018-19 and deductible in that year.
