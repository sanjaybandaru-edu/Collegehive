# Expectations Approach

The **Expectations Approach** posits that the futures price reflects the market's consensus of the expected future spot price. Under this theory:

\[
F = E(S_T)
\]

Where:
- **F**: Futures price
- **E(S_T)**: Expected spot price at maturity **T**

This approach assumes that futures prices are unbiased estimators of future spot prices, implying no systematic profit opportunities from trading futures contracts.

## Difference Between Spot Price and Futures/Forward Price: Basis

The **Basis** is the difference between the spot price of an asset and its corresponding futures price:

\[
\text{Basis} = \text{Spot Price} - \text{Futures Price}
\]

- **Positive Basis**: Indicates **backwardation**, where the spot price is higher than the futures price.
- **Negative Basis**: Indicates **contango**, where the futures price is higher than the spot price.

**Example:**

If the spot price of gold is $1,200 per ounce and the futures price for delivery in three months is $1,250 per ounce:

\[
\text{Basis} = 1200 - 1250 = -50
\]

This negative basis of **$50** indicates a contango market.
