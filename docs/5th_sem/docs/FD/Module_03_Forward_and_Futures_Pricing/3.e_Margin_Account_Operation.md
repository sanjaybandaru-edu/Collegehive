# Margin Account Operation

In futures trading, margin accounts are used to manage credit risk between parties. They ensure that both buyers and sellers can fulfill their contractual obligations.

1. **Initial Margin**: The upfront deposit required to enter into a futures position. It acts as a performance bond.

   *Example:* To enter a futures contract for 100 barrels of oil, with an initial margin requirement of $1,000, the trader must deposit $1,000 into their margin account.

2. **Maintenance Margin**: The minimum account balance that must be maintained. If the account balance falls below this level due to adverse price movements, a margin call is issued, requiring the trader to deposit additional funds.

   *Example:* If the maintenance margin is set at $800 and the account balance drops to $750, the trader will receive a margin call to bring the balance back to the initial margin level.

3. **Mark-to-Market**: Daily adjustment of the margin account to reflect gains or losses based on the day's closing prices. Profits are added to the account, and losses are deducted.

   *Example:* If the futures position gains $200 in value on a particular day, the margin account is credited with $200. Conversely, if it loses $200, the account is debited accordingly.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing risk and making informed decisions in the derivatives market.
