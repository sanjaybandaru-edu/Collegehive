## Economic Motives for Swaps

The primary economic motives for engaging in swaps include:

1. **Risk Management**: Hedge against adverse movements in interest rates or currency exchange rates.
2. **Cost Reduction**: Lower borrowing costs or enhance investment returns by leveraging comparative advantages in different markets.
3. **Access to New Markets**: Facilitate access to capital markets that may otherwise be inaccessible or less favorable.
