
## Uses of Swaps to Manage Risk

Swaps are versatile tools in risk management strategies:

- **Interest Rate Risk**: Lock in fixed rates to mitigate rising rate risks or switch to floating rates to benefit from potential declines.
- **Currency Risk**: Align currency inflows and outflows to stabilize earnings.
- **Asset-Liability Matching**: Align interest rate profiles of assets and liabilities to reduce mismatches.
