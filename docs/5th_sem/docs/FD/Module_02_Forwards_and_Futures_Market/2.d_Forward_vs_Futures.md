| **Aspect**                     | **Forwards Contracts**                                                                 | **Futures Contracts**                                                                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trading Venue**              | Over-the-counter (OTC) market, privately negotiated between parties.                    | Traded on regulated exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).        |
| **Contract Customization**     | Fully customizable: terms like quantity, price, and settlement date can be tailored.   | Standardized contracts with fixed terms regarding quantity, expiration, and settlement. |
| **Counterparty Risk**          | High counterparty risk due to the absence of a central clearinghouse.                   | Lower counterparty risk, as exchanges use central clearinghouses to guarantee performance. |
| **Settlement**                 | Typically settled at maturity, with the possibility of physical or cash settlement.     | Marked to market daily, with gains and losses settled daily; physical or cash settlement at maturity. |
| **Margin Requirements**        | No margin requirements, but collateral may be required depending on the parties' agreement. | Requires initial and maintenance margins, determined by the exchange.                |
| **Liquidity**                  | Generally less liquid due to the OTC nature and customization of contracts.             | Highly liquid, with active trading on exchanges and standardized contracts.          |
| **Regulation**                 | Less regulated, with terms and enforcement relying on the agreement between parties.    | Heavily regulated by exchanges and regulatory bodies, ensuring transparency and compliance. |
| **Pricing Transparency**       | Prices are not publicly available, as forwards are privately negotiated.                | Prices are transparent and publicly available, quoted on exchanges.                 |
| **Typical Users**              | Corporations, financial institutions, and entities with specific hedging needs.         | Traders, speculators, hedgers, and arbitrageurs in both retail and institutional markets. |
| **Contract Settlement Date**   | The settlement date is flexible and mutually agreed upon by the parties.                | Standardized expiration dates set by the exchange (e.g., monthly, quarterly).        |
| **Purpose**                    | Primarily used for hedging specific risks in commodities, currencies, or interest rates. | Used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage across a wide range of markets.         |
| **Contract Size**              | Variable and negotiated between the contracting parties.                                | Fixed and standardized by the exchange.                                              |
| **Example**                    | A company and a bank agree on a forward contract to exchange $1 million in six months at a predetermined rate. | A trader buys a futures contract to purchase 100 barrels of oil at $70 per barrel, expiring in three months. |
