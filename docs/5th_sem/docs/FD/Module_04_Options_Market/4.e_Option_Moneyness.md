# Option Moneyness

### Definitions:
1. **In-the-Money (ITM)**:
   - **Call Option**: \( S_T > K \)
   - **Put Option**: \( S_T < K \)

2. **At-the-Money (ATM)**:
   - \( S_T = K \)

3. **Out-of-the-Money (OTM)**:
   - **Call Option**: \( S_T < K \)
   - **Put Option**: \( S_T > K \)

**Example**:
- For a stock trading at $50:
  - A call option with a strike price of $40 is **ITM**.
  - A call option with a strike price of $50 is **ATM**.
  - A call option with a strike price of $60 is **OTM**.
