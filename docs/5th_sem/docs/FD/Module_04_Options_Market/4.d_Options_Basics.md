# Options Basics

### 1. Exercise Price (Strike Price):
The price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold if the option is exercised.
- **Call Option**: Benefits if the market price exceeds the strike price.
- **Put Option**: Benefits if the market price falls below the strike price.

### 2. Expiration Date:
The last date on which the option can be exercised. After this date, the option becomes worthless.
- **Short-term options**: Valid for days or weeks.
- **Long-term options**: Valid for months or years (e.g., LEAPS - Long-term Equity Anticipation Securities).

### 3. Pay-off from Options:
Payoff depends on the type of option and the underlying asset price at expiration.

- **Call Option Payoff**:
  - If \( S_T > K \), Payoff = \( S_T - K \)
  - If \( S_T \leq K \), Payoff = \( 0 \)

- **Put Option Payoff**:
  - If \( S_T < K \), Payoff = \( K - S_T \)
  - If \( S_T \geq K \), Payoff = \( 0 \)

Where:
- \( S_T \): Underlying asset price at expiration
- \( K \): Strike price

**Example**:
- A call option with a strike price of $100 and expiration price of $120 has a payoff of \( 120 - 100 = $20 \).
- A put option with a strike price of $100 and expiration price of $90 has a payoff of \( 100 - 90 = $10 \).
