Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) before or on a specified expiration date. This flexibility allows investors to hedge against potential losses, speculate on future price movements, or generate additional income.
