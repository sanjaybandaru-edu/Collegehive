## 2. Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

Introduced in 1973, the Black-Scholes model provides a closed-form solution for pricing European-style options, which can only be exercised at expiration.

**Key Features**:
- Assumes constant volatility and interest rates.
- Does not account for dividends (though extensions of the model do).
- Provides a formula to calculate the theoretical price of European call and put options.

**Formula**:
\[
C = S \cdot N(d_1) - X \cdot e^{-rT} \cdot N(d_2)
\]

Where:
- **C**: Call option price
- **S**: Current stock price
- **X**: Strike price
- **r**: Risk-free interest rate
- **T**: Time to expiration
- **N**: Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution
- \[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/X) + (r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}
\]
- \[
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T}
\]
- **Ïƒ**: Volatility of the underlying asset

**Example**:
For a stock priced at $100, with a strike price of $100, time to expiration of 1 year, risk-free rate of 5%, and volatility of 20%, the Black-Scholes formula can be used to calculate the theoretical price of a European call option.
