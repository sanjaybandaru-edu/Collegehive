# Factors Affecting Options Pricing

The price of an option is determined by multiple variables:

1. **Underlying Asset Price**: 
   - The current price of the asset on which the option is based.
   - For call options, as the underlying asset's price increases, the option's value typically rises; conversely, for put options, the value decreases.

2. **Strike Price (Exercise Price)**: 
   - The predetermined price at which the option can be exercised.
   - The relationship between the strike price and the underlying asset's current price affects the option's intrinsic value.

3. **Time to Expiration**: 
   - The duration remaining until the option's expiration date.
   - Options with longer times to expiration generally have higher premiums due to the increased probability of the option ending up in-the-money.

4. **Volatility**: 
   - A measure of the underlying asset's price fluctuations.
   - Higher volatility increases the likelihood of the option becoming profitable, thereby raising its premium.

5. **Risk-Free Interest Rate**: 
   - The theoretical return on an investment with zero risk, often represented by government bond yields.
   - Changes in interest rates can influence the present value of the option's strike price, affecting its premium.

6. **Dividends**: 
   - Expected dividends from the underlying asset can impact option pricing, especially for call options, as dividends can reduce the asset's price on the ex-dividend date.
