Arbitrage Pricing Theory, developed by Stephen Ross in 1976, is a multi-factor asset pricing model that determines the return of an asset based on multiple sources of systematic risk. It offers a more flexible alternative to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which relies on a single market factor.

## Overview

APT posits that the return of a security is influenced by various macroeconomic factors or theoretical market indices, and not solely by market risk. These factors could include inflation rates, exchange rates, interest rates, and others.

## Formula

The expected return according to APT can be modeled as:

$E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_1 F_1 + \beta_2 F_2 + \dots + \beta_k F_k + \epsilon_i$

Where:

- $E(R_i)$ is the expected return of asset `i`.
- $R_f$ is the risk-free rate.
- $beta_k$ represents the sensitivity of the asset to factor `k`.
- $F_k$ represents a systematic risk factor `k`.
- $epsilon_i$ is an idiosyncratic risk or noise component.

## Key Points

- **Multiple Factors**: APT considers multiple factors affecting returns, providing a broader view of influences on asset prices.
- **No Arbitrage**: Assumes no arbitrage opportunities; profits should not be achievable without risk.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for the inclusion of various factors as needed to explain asset returns, making it adaptable to different investing contexts.
