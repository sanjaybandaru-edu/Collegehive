# Portfolio Evaluation

Portfolio evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of an investment portfolio to determine its effectiveness in achieving the dual objectives of minimizing risk and maximizing returns. This evaluation involves comparing the returns of a portfolio against a benchmark or another portfolio to gauge its relative performance.

## Measurement of Portfolio Returns

The evaluation of a portfolio starts with the measurement of its returns. Returns are typically analyzed in the context of the risk taken to achieve them, leading to the concept of risk-adjusted returns.

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

While absolute returns can provide a straightforward view of gains or losses, they may be misleading as they do not account for the risk involved. Risk-adjusted returns, therefore, are crucial as they measure the return earned per unit of risk taken, providing a clearer picture of performance.

#### Methods for Calculation of Risk-Adjusted Returns

1. **Sharpe Ratio (Reward to Variability Ratio)**

     - The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the return of the portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
   - Formula: $Sharpe\ Ratio = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}$
    - Where:
        - $R_p$ is the return of the portfolio,
        - $R_f$ is the risk-free rate,
        - $\sigma_p$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
    - A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more favorable risk-adjusted performance.

2. **Treynor Ratio (Reward to Volatility Ratio)**
     - The Treynor Ratio measures returns earned in excess of what could have been earned on a riskless investment per each unit of market risk.
     - Formula: $Treynor\ Ratio = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\beta_p}$
        - Where:
          - $R_p$ is the return of the portfolio,
          - $R_f$ is the risk-free rate,
          - $\beta_p$ is the beta of the portfolio.
      - It is particularly useful for portfolios that are well-diversified.

3. **Differential Return (Jensen's Alpha)**
    - Developed by Michael Jensen, this ratio attempts to measure the differential return between the actual return earned on a portfolio and the expected return based on the portfolio’s risk level.
    - Formula:  
      $Jensen's\ Alpha = R_p - (R_f + \beta_p (R_m - R_f))$
      - Where:
          - $R_p$ is the actual return of the portfolio,
          - $R_f$ is the risk-free rate,
          - $\beta_p$ is the beta of the portfolio,
          - $R_m$ is the expected market return.
    - A positive Jensen’s Alpha indicates a manager’s ability to generate excess returns over those predicted by the CAPM.

### Portfolio Evaluation Process

Evaluating a portfolio involves several steps:

1. **Performance Measurement**: Determining the returns of the portfolio over a specified period.
2. **Benchmark Comparison**: Comparing these returns to those of a benchmark or comparable portfolios.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Analyzing the amount of risk taken to achieve these returns.
4. **Adjustment for Risk**: Applying metrics like the Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and Jensen's Alpha to assess performance relative to the risk incurred.

### Conclusion

Effective portfolio evaluation not only measures the success or failure of investment strategies but also helps in understanding the efficiency and skill of the portfolio manager. By using various methods of risk-adjusted returns, investors and managers can get a more nuanced view of portfolio performance, essential for strategic decision-making and improvement.
