# Markowitz Efficient Frontier

The Efficient Frontier is a fundamental concept in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) introduced by Harry Markowitz in his seminal paper in 1952. The Efficient Frontier represents a set of portfolios that provides the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

## Concept

The Efficient Frontier is a curve on a graph where the x-axis represents risk (typically measured as the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns) and the y-axis represents return (typically the expected return of the portfolio). Each point on the curve represents an optimal portfolio of investments that maximizes return for a given amount of risk.

### Key Features

1. **Non-Dominated Portfolios**: Each portfolio on the Efficient Frontier offers the best possible expected return for its level of risk. These are known as non-dominated portfolios because no other portfolios offer higher returns for the same risk or lower risk for the same returns.

2. **Diversification**: The Efficient Frontier highlights the benefits of diversification, showing how combining different assets can lead to portfolios that have less risk than individual assets for a given return.

3. **Risk-Return Trade-Off**: The curve demonstrates the trade-off between risk and return, illustrating that higher returns are generally accompanied by higher risk.

## Construction

To construct the Efficient Frontier, an investor or analyst uses the following inputs:

- **Expected Returns**: The mean return for each asset.
- **Volatility**: The standard deviation of returns for each asset, representing risk.
- **Correlation**: The correlation coefficients between each pair of assets.

### Steps

1. **Define the Universe of Possible Portfolios**: Include all combinations of the available assets.
2. **Calculate Expected Return and Volatility**: For each portfolio, calculate the expected return and the standard deviation.
3. **Plot the Portfolios**: On a graph with risk on the x-axis and return on the y-axis.
4. **Identify the Efficient Frontier**: The upper part of the plotted curve, where no portfolios can offer higher returns for the same risk or less risk for the same returns.

## Application

Investors use the Efficient Frontier to choose portfolios that align with their risk tolerance and return objectives. By selecting a portfolio on the Efficient Frontier, investors can ensure they are getting the maximum possible return for their chosen level of risk.

### Portfolio Selection

- **Risk Averse Investors**: Might choose portfolios towards the left end of the curve, where there is lower risk but also lower return.
- **Risk Tolerant Investors**: Might opt for portfolios towards the right end of the curve, accepting higher risk for potentially higher returns.

## Limitations

While the Efficient Frontier provides a powerful tool for portfolio selection, it relies on the assumptions that returns are normally distributed and markets are efficient. It also does not account for real-world factors such as transaction costs and taxes.

### Conclusion

Understanding the Efficient Frontier allows investors to make more informed decisions about their investment strategies, balancing their risk against their return objectives. However, they must also consider the limitations and assumptions underlying the model.
