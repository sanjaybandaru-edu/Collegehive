## 1. Systematic Risk

**Systematic Risk** (also known as market risk or non-diversifiable risk) is the risk that affects the entire market or a large segment of the market. It is driven by factors that influence the overall economy or financial markets, such as economic recessions, interest rate changes, inflation, political instability, or natural disasters.

Systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification because it impacts all securities to some extent. Since it is inherent to the market as a whole, systematic risk is often considered unavoidable, and investors need to be aware of its potential impact on their portfolio.

#### Examples of Systematic Risk:
- **Market Risk**: The risk of losses due to overall market movements. For example, during a market downturn, the prices of most stocks tend to fall, regardless of the company's individual performance.
- **Interest Rate Risk**: The risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of investments, particularly bonds. When interest rates rise, bond prices typically fall.
- **Inflation Risk**: The risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of returns. High inflation can reduce the real value of future cash flows from investments.
- **Political Risk**: The risk of political instability or changes in government policy that could negatively impact the financial markets.

## 2. Unsystematic Risk

**Unsystematic Risk** (also known as specific risk, diversifiable risk, or idiosyncratic risk) is the risk that is unique to a particular company or industry. It arises from factors that are specific to a single company or industry, such as management decisions, labor strikes, product recalls, or regulatory changes affecting a particular sector.

Unlike systematic risk, unsystematic risk can be significantly reduced or even eliminated through diversification. By holding a well-diversified portfolio of different assets, investors can spread out their exposure to unsystematic risks, minimizing the impact of any single asset's poor performance on the overall portfolio.

#### Examples of Unsystematic Risk:
- **Business Risk**: The risk associated with the operational efficiency and management of a company. For example, poor management decisions, production failures, or supply chain disruptions can adversely affect a company's profitability.
  - **Internal Business Risk**: Risks related to the internal operations of the company, such as operational inefficiencies or poor decision-making.
  - **External Business Risk**: Risks related to external factors, such as competition, changes in consumer preferences, or economic conditions affecting the industry.
- **Financial Risk**: The risk associated with a company's capital structure, particularly the use of debt. High levels of debt increase the risk of financial distress if the company cannot meet its interest obligations.

## Other Risks

### Management Risk
- Poor management decisions can lead to losses.

### Marketability Risk
- Loss of liquidity or difficulty in converting assets without a loss in value.

### Political Risk
- Changes in government policies, tax rates, or regulations can affect investments.



# Risk and Risk Aversion

Investors' attitudes towards risk can be broadly categorized as risk-averse or risk-seeking.

## Risk Aversion

Risk-averse investors prefer investments with lower risk, such as:


- Bank deposits
- Mutual funds
- Debentures
- Government securities

## Risk Seeking

Conversely, risk-seeking investors may prefer higher-risk investments, including:


- Equities
- Company fixed deposits
- Venture funds
- Startups or new companies

Understanding the different types of risks and investors' risk tolerance is crucial for financial planning and investment decision-making.
