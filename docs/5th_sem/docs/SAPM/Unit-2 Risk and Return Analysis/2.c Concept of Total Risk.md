# Total Risk

**Total Risk** in an investment context refers to the overall uncertainty or variability of returns that an investor may experience. It encompasses all the potential sources of risk that could affect the returns on an investment. Understanding total risk is crucial for investors as it helps them evaluate the potential volatility of their investment and the likelihood of achieving their expected returns.

Total risk is composed of two primary components:

1. **Systematic Risk**
2. **Unsystematic Risk**

### Total Risk: The Combination of Systematic and Unsystematic Risk

**Total Risk** is the sum of systematic risk and unsystematic risk. It represents the full spectrum of potential variability in an investment's returns. The total risk of an investment is important for investors to understand because it encompasses all possible risks that could affect their portfolio's performance.

#### Total Risk Formula:
\[
\text{Total Risk} = \text{Systematic Risk} + \text{Unsystematic Risk}
\]

Since systematic risk cannot be diversified away, investors must accept it as part of their investment strategy. However, they can reduce unsystematic risk through diversification, thereby lowering the total risk of their investment portfolio.

### Risk Measurement and Its Importance

Risk is typically measured using standard deviation, which quantifies the extent of variability in an investment's returns relative to its mean return. A higher standard deviation indicates greater risk, as it suggests that the returns are more likely to deviate from the expected value.

#### Formula for Standard Deviation:
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i \cdot \left( R_i - E(R) \right)^2 }
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation,
- \( P_i \) is the probability of each scenario,
- \( R_i \) is the return in each scenario,
- \( E(R) \) is the expected return.

Standard deviation is a key tool for assessing total risk because it captures the combined effect of both systematic and unsystematic risks on the variability of returns.

### Managing Total Risk

Investors need to be aware of total risk when constructing their portfolios. While systematic risk is unavoidable, investors can mitigate unsystematic risk through diversification. By holding a diversified portfolio, investors can reduce the total risk and increase the likelihood of achieving more stable and predictable returns.

Understanding the components of total risk allows investors to make informed decisions about their risk tolerance, asset allocation, and investment strategy, ultimately helping them achieve their financial goals.
