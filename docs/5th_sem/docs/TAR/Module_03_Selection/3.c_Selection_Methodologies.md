# Selection Interview

A selection interview is an oral examination where candidates are assessed for employment. It is a crucial step in the hiring process, as it helps the interviewer gather and evaluate information about the candidate's abilities in relation to the job requirements.

## Types of Selection Interviews

### 1. Non-Directive (Unstructured) Interview
- In a non-directive interview, the interviewer asks questions spontaneously without following a specific format. 
- The questions are open-ended, allowing the candidate to speak freely with minimal interruption.

### 2. Directive (Structured) Interview
- A directive interview involves a set of predetermined questions that are job-related.
- All candidates are asked the same questions, making it easier to compare them.
- This method improves the reliability of the interview, reduces biases, and strengthens the legal defensibility of the selection process.

### 3. Situational Interview
- In a situational interview, candidates are presented with a hypothetical scenario and asked how they would respond.
- Their responses are then evaluated against established benchmarks.

### 4. Behavioral Interview
- A behavioral interview focuses on the candidate's past experiences and how they handled specific work situations.
- For example, a candidate may be asked to describe how they disciplined an employee for misconduct.

### 5. Stress Interview
- In a stress interview, the interviewer deliberately asks aggressive or uncomfortable questions to see how the candidate handles stress.
- This approach helps assess whether the candidate can remain calm and composed in high-pressure situations.

### 6. Panel Interview
- A panel interview involves 3-5 interviewers who take turns asking questions.
- After the interview, the panel members discuss their observations to reach a consensus on the candidate's suitability.
- Panel interviews help reduce individual biases and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the candidate.
