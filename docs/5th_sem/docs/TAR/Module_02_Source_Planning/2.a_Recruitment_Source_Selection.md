# Recruitment

Recruitment is the process by which an organization locates and encourages potential applicants to apply for existing or anticipated job openings. It is a crucial step in ensuring that the organization attracts the right talent to meet its needs.

## Objectives of Recruitment

1. **Attracting Qualified Applicants:**
   - The primary goal of recruitment is to attract a large pool of qualified applicants who are ready and willing to take up the job if it is offered to them.

2. **Self-Selection by Unqualified Candidates:**
   - Recruitment also aims to provide enough information about the job and the organization so that unqualified candidates can self-select themselves out of the application process, saving both time and resources for the organization.

## Informing the Job Market

Through the recruitment process, the organization informs the job market about potential vacancies and encourages qualified candidates to apply. This can be done through various channels, including job postings, advertisements, and recruitment agencies.

## Sources of Recruitment

The sources of recruitment can be broadly divided into two categories:

- **Internal Sources of Recruitment:** 
   - These include current employees within the organization who may be promoted, transferred, or otherwise moved into new positions.

- **External Sources of Recruitment:**
   - These involve attracting candidates from outside the organization, including new graduates, experienced professionals, and others who are not currently employed by the company.
