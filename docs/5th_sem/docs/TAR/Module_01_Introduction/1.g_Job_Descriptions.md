### Key Components of a Job Description

1. **Job Title:** Specifies the job title, code number, and department.
2. **Job Summary:** A brief overview of what the job entails.
3. **Job Activities:** Details the tasks performed, facilities used, and the extent of supervisory support.
4. **Working Conditions:** Describes the physical environment, including aspects like heat, light, noise, and other potential hazards.
