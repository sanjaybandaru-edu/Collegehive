# Balanced Scorecard

The *Balanced Scorecard (BSC)* is a strategic management tool developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton. It provides a comprehensive framework for tracking and managing an organization’s performance by going beyond traditional financial metrics. The balanced scorecard evaluates an organization from four key perspectives: *Financial*, *Customer*, *Internal Processes*, and *Learning and Growth*. By balancing these perspectives, organizations can ensure a holistic approach to strategy implementation and performance monitoring.
