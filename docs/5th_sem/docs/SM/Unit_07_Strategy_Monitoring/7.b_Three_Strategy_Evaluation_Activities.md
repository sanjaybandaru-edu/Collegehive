# Three Strategy Evaluation Activities

The *Three Strategy Evaluation Activities* are essential steps that help organizations assess and maintain the effectiveness of their strategies. These activities ensure that the strategy remains aligned with organizational goals, adapts to changing conditions, and achieves desired results. The activities include: *Examining the Underlying Bases of a Firm's Strategy*, *Comparing Expected Results to Actual Results*, and *Taking Corrective Actions to Ensure Performance Conforms to Plans*.

## 1. Examining the Underlying Bases of a Firm’s Strategy

Examining the underlying bases of a strategy involves reassessing the assumptions, conditions, and factors that were initially considered when the strategy was developed. This step is crucial because changes in external or internal conditions may affect the relevance of the strategy.

- **Definition**: This activity involves reviewing the foundational assumptions about market conditions, competition, customer needs, and internal resources to ensure they are still accurate.
- **Purpose**: To confirm that the strategy is still relevant and based on valid assumptions, avoiding reliance on outdated or incorrect information.
- **Key Aspects**:
  - **External Factors**: Analyzing market trends, economic conditions, technological advancements, and competitive dynamics.
  - **Internal Factors**: Assessing organizational resources, capabilities, and overall readiness.
- **Example**: A technology firm might review its strategy if there is a significant change in industry technology, which could impact product development plans and competitive positioning.

## 2. Comparing Expected Results to Actual Results

This step involves measuring actual performance against the expected results to determine whether the strategy is achieving its intended outcomes. It provides insights into the effectiveness of the strategy and highlights any deviations from expected performance.

- **Definition**: Comparing expected to actual results involves collecting and analyzing performance data to evaluate the success of the strategy.
- **Purpose**: To identify gaps between what was planned and what has been achieved, enabling management to understand how well the strategy is working.
- **Key Aspects**:
  - **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Track metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins, market share, and customer satisfaction.
  - **Variance Analysis**: Analyzing the difference between actual and expected results to pinpoint areas of concern.
- **Example**: A retail chain that set a target for a 10% increase in sales might compare actual sales data to determine if this target was met, exceeded, or missed.

## 3. Taking Corrective Actions to Ensure Performance Conforms to Plans

If there are significant gaps between actual and expected results, corrective actions are taken to realign performance with strategic objectives. This could involve modifying the strategy, reallocating resources, or adjusting specific goals to address performance shortfalls.

- **Definition**: Taking corrective actions involves making necessary adjustments to the strategy or its implementation to close performance gaps.
- **Purpose**: To ensure that any deviations from the plan are addressed promptly, maintaining alignment with the organization’s strategic goals.
- **Key Aspects**:
  - **Identifying Causes**: Determine why there are discrepancies, such as resource limitations, market changes, or operational inefficiencies.
  - **Implementing Adjustments**: Modifying strategy, adjusting budgets, reallocating resources, or redefining timelines as needed.
  - **Continuous Monitoring**: Track progress after adjustments to ensure the effectiveness of corrective actions.
- **Example**: If a new product launch fails to meet sales targets, a company may increase marketing efforts or adjust pricing to improve results.

## Importance of the Three Strategy Evaluation Activities

1. **Ensures Strategic Relevance**: Regularly examining the underlying bases of the strategy keeps it aligned with current conditions.
2. **Promotes Accountability**: Measuring actual results against expectations allows the organization to hold teams accountable for strategic goals.
3. **Supports Continuous Improvement**: Taking corrective actions enables the organization to refine and improve its strategy, ensuring ongoing effectiveness.

By following these three strategy evaluation activities, organizations can effectively monitor, adapt, and enhance their strategic plans to achieve long-term success.
