# Integrating Strategy and Culture

## Overview

Organizational culture can be defined as a “pattern of behavior that has been developed by an organization as it learns to cope with its problem of external adaptation and internal integration, and that has worked well enough to be considered valid and to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel.” This culture is an internal phenomenon unique to every business entity and captures the subtle, elusive, and largely unconscious forces that shape the workplace environment.

## The Role of Organizational Culture

Organizational culture plays a crucial role in shaping business decisions and strategic management processes. Cultural products, which include values, beliefs, rites, rituals, ceremonies, myths, stories, legends, sagas, language, metaphors, symbols, heroes, and heroines, contribute to this culture. These elements can either be strengths or weaknesses within the organization and have a significant impact on strategic planning activities.

### Cultural Products

- **Values and Beliefs**: The core principles and standards that guide behavior within the organization.
- **Rites and Rituals**: Formal or informal activities that reinforce the organization’s culture.
- **Stories and Myths**: Narratives that convey the history and values of the organization.
- **Symbols and Heroes**: Icons and individuals that embody the organization's values.

## Integrating Strategy and Culture

The strategic-management process is deeply intertwined with an organization’s culture. Organizational culture significantly affects business decisions and must be carefully evaluated during an internal strategic-management audit. Ignoring the influence of culture can lead to barriers in communication and an inability to adapt to changing conditions, which can hinder the successful implementation of strategies.

### Impact of Culture on Strategic Management

- **Strategy Formulation**: Culture influences how strategies are conceived and what strategic options are considered viable.
- **Strategy Implementation**: A strong alignment between strategy and culture can infuse individuals with enthusiasm and commitment, ensuring successful execution.
- **Strategy Evaluation**: Cultural alignment also affects how strategies are monitored and adjusted over time.

### Challenges in Integrating Culture

When one firm acquires another, integrating the two cultures becomes a critical task. The challenge is to bring about the necessary changes in organizational culture and individual mindsets to support the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of strategies. This integration process can be complex, requiring sensitivity to the existing cultural elements while fostering a new, unified culture that aligns with the strategic objectives.

### Strategic Management and Cultural Change

One of the biggest challenges in strategic management today is to effectively bring about changes in organizational culture that are necessary to support strategic objectives. This may involve altering deeply ingrained behaviors, mindsets, and norms within the organization to better align with the desired strategic direction.

## Conclusion

Integrating strategy and culture is essential for the success of any organization. The culture of an organization should support and enhance its strategic objectives, fostering an environment where strategies can be effectively formulated, implemented, and evaluated. Ignoring the cultural dimension can lead to significant barriers, whereas leveraging culture can lead to a more cohesive, motivated, and strategically aligned organization.
