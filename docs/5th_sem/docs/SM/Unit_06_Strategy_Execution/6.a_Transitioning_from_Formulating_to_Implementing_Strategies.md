# Transitioning from Strategy Formulation to Strategy Implementation

Successful strategy formulation does not guarantee successful strategy implementation. Although formulating a strategy is critical, it is only the first step; effectively implementing that strategy is essential for achieving the desired results. Strategy formulation and implementation have distinct characteristics and focus areas, and transitioning from one phase to the other involves a significant shift in responsibilities.

Below are the key differences between strategy formulation and strategy implementation:

| **Aspect**                   | **Strategy Formulation**                                         | **Strategy Implementation**                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nature of Process**        | Positioning forces before the action                             | Managing forces during the action                                |
| **Primary Focus**            | Effectiveness                                                    | Efficiency                                                       |
| **Process Type**             | Primarily an intellectual process                                | Primarily an operational process                                 |
| **Required Skills**          | Good intuitive and analytical skills                            | Special motivation and leadership skills                         |
| **Coordination Needs**       | Coordination among a few individuals                            | Coordination among many individuals                              |

### Explanation of Key Differences

1. **Nature of Process**:
   - **Formulation** involves setting the stage and aligning resources and forces in anticipation of future actions. This phase is more about planning and preparing the organization.
   - **Implementation** is focused on managing and guiding resources during the action, often dealing with unexpected challenges and ensuring the strategy is actively carried out.

2. **Primary Focus**:
   - **Formulation** emphasizes **effectiveness** — ensuring that the strategy is correct and aligns with the organization's goals.
   - **Implementation** prioritizes **efficiency** — ensuring that actions are performed correctly, resources are used optimally, and outcomes align with expectations.

3. **Process Type**:
   - **Formulation** is largely an intellectual and creative process where strategic options are explored and selected.
   - **Implementation** is operational, focusing on practical tasks, day-to-day activities, and real-time decision-making.

4. **Required Skills**:
   - **Formulation** demands intuitive and analytical abilities to evaluate various strategic possibilities.
   - **Implementation** requires motivational and leadership skills to encourage and direct teams toward executing the strategy.

5. **Coordination Needs**:
   - **Formulation** generally involves a few key individuals or strategists at the top levels.
   - **Implementation** requires coordination across multiple levels, involving both divisional and functional managers and teams.

## Transition from Strategy Formulation to Strategy Implementation

Transitioning from strategy formulation to implementation involves more than just following a plan; it requires shifting responsibilities from high-level strategists to divisional and functional managers. This shift can create implementation challenges, especially if middle- and lower-level managers were not involved in or are surprised by the formulated strategy. Clear communication, alignment of goals, and empowering managers are essential to bridge this gap.

### Common Implementation Challenges

1. **Lack of Clear Communication**: When strategy formulation decisions are not communicated clearly to all levels, managers responsible for implementation may misunderstand or misalign with the goals.
2. **Resistance to Change**: Shifting from planning to action can meet resistance, especially if employees or managers are unsure of their roles in the new strategy.
3. **Resource Allocation Issues**: Implementing a strategy often requires reallocation of resources. If these resources are not available or not allocated effectively, the implementation can falter.
4. **Leadership and Motivation**: Successful implementation depends on motivated teams led by managers with strong leadership abilities.
