## 1. Social Responsibility in Strategy Evaluation

**Social Responsibility** refers to an organization’s commitment to act in the best interests of society and contribute positively to the community and environment. When evaluating strategies, companies assess whether their decisions will promote social good and minimize harm to society and the environment.

- **Definition**: Social responsibility is the obligation of a business to contribute to the welfare of society, considering the impact of its operations on stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, and the environment.
- **Key Areas of Focus**:
  - **Environmental Sustainability**: Ensuring that strategies do not harm the environment and, where possible, contribute to its preservation (e.g., reducing carbon emissions, managing waste, conserving resources).
  - **Community Impact**: Evaluating how strategies affect local communities, including job creation, community support, and health/safety considerations.
  - **Employee Well-being**: Considering the impact of strategies on employee welfare, fair wages, and safe working conditions.
- **Examples**:
  - A company may evaluate a new manufacturing strategy by assessing its environmental impact, aiming to reduce pollution and waste.
  - A retail firm might prioritize a strategy that involves sourcing products from suppliers with fair labor practices.

Incorporating social responsibility as a parameter ensures that the company’s strategies contribute positively to society, enhancing its reputation and fostering goodwill.

## 2. Ethical Sensitivity in Strategy Evaluation

**Ethical Sensitivity** involves evaluating whether a strategy aligns with ethical principles, such as honesty, fairness, and integrity. This parameter ensures that the organization’s strategies do not exploit or harm stakeholders and that they align with both legal and moral standards.

- **Definition**: Ethical sensitivity is the awareness and consideration of ethical issues when evaluating and selecting strategies, ensuring actions are morally acceptable and do not harm stakeholders.
- **Key Areas of Focus**:
  - **Fairness**: Ensuring strategies are fair to all stakeholders, avoiding exploitative practices.
  - **Transparency**: Promoting openness and honesty in strategic decisions, especially regarding how they affect employees, customers, and shareholders.
  - **Compliance with Laws**: Ensuring that all strategic decisions adhere to legal standards and avoid unethical practices like corruption, discrimination, or misleading advertising.
- **Examples**:
  - A financial institution evaluating an investment strategy may consider the ethical implications, avoiding investments in industries with questionable practices (e.g., tobacco or arms manufacturing).
  - A company deciding on a pricing strategy may consider its impact on low-income consumers, avoiding exploitative pricing models.

Incorporating ethical sensitivity ensures that strategies are not only legally compliant but also morally sound, protecting the organization’s integrity and building trust with stakeholders.
