# Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM)

The *Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM)* is a tool that helps organizations objectively evaluate and prioritize strategic alternatives based on specific criteria. By assigning weights and scores, the QSPM provides a structured approach for decision-making, allowing organizations to select the most attractive strategy based on quantitative analysis. It is particularly useful in the **Decision Stage** of the strategy formulation process.

## Purpose of the QSPM

The QSPM helps organizations:
- Objectively compare multiple strategic options.
- Prioritize strategies based on their attractiveness.
- Make informed decisions based on quantitative data rather than subjective judgment.

## Key Components of the QSPM

The QSPM is structured into several components:

1. **Key Factors**: Identifies the internal and external factors affecting strategic decisions. These factors are often derived from tools like the **SWOT Analysis**, **IFE Matrix**, and **EFE Matrix**.
   
2. **Weights**: Assigns a weight to each key factor based on its importance. Weights typically range from 0 to 1, with the sum of all weights equaling 1.

3. **Strategic Alternatives**: Lists the different strategic options or alternatives being considered, such as market expansion, product development, or cost reduction.

4. **Attractiveness Scores (AS)**: Each strategic alternative is assigned an attractiveness score for each factor. Scores typically range from 1 (not attractive) to 4 (highly attractive) based on how well the strategy aligns with the factor.

5. **Total Attractiveness Scores (TAS)**: Calculated by multiplying each factorâ€™s weight by its attractiveness score for each strategy. The TAS values are then summed for each strategy to determine its overall attractiveness.

## QSPM Structure

The QSPM Matrix layout is as follows:

| **SN** | **Internal Factors**       | **Weight** | **Strategy 1** |     | **Strategy 2** |     |
|--------|-----------------------------|------------|----------------|-----|----------------|-----|
|        |                             |            | **AS**         | **TAS** | **AS**         | **TAS** |
| 1      | Internal Factor 1           | 0.30       | 4              | 1.20   | 4              | 1.20   |
| 2      | Internal Factor 2           | 0.15       | 3              | 0.45   | 3              | 0.45   |
| 3      | Internal Factor 3           | 0.25       | 2              | 0.50   | 3              | 0.75   |
| 4      | Internal Factor 4           | 0.30       | 3              | 0.90   | 2              | 0.60   |
|        | **Total TAS (Internal)**    | **1.00**   |                | **3.05** |                | **3.00** |


| **SN** | **External Factors**       | **Weight** | **Strategy 1** |     | **Strategy 2** |     |
|--------|----------------------------|------------|----------------|-----|----------------|-----|
|        |                            |            | **AS**         | **TAS** | **AS**         | **TAS** |
| 1      | External Factor 1          | 0.25       | 2              | 0.50   | 3              | 0.75   |
| 2      | External Factor 2          | 0.20       | 4              | 0.80   | 3              | 0.60   |
| 3      | External Factor 3          | 0.30       | 3              | 0.90   | 2              | 0.60   |

|        | **Total TAS (External)**   | **1.00**   |                | **3.20** |                | **2.95** |



**Explanation of Columns**:
- **Key Factors**: Lists factors (both internal and external) impacting strategic choices.
- **Weight**: Indicates the importance of each factor.
- **AS** (Attractiveness Score): Rates how attractive each strategy is based on each factor.
- **TAS** (Total Attractiveness Score): Calculated by multiplying the weight by the attractiveness score for each factor.

## Steps to Create a QSPM

1. **Identify Key Factors**: List critical internal and external factors from the IFE and EFE matrices.
   
2. **Assign Weights**: Assign a weight to each factor based on its significance, with weights summing up to 1.

3. **List Strategic Alternatives**: Identify the strategic options under consideration.

4. **Assign Attractiveness Scores**: Rate each strategy for each factor (1 = not attractive; 4 = highly attractive).

5. **Calculate Total Attractiveness Scores (TAS)**: Multiply the weight by the attractiveness score for each factor and add up the TAS values for each strategy.

6. **Analyze the Results**: Compare the total TAS for each strategy. The strategy with the highest TAS is generally the most attractive option.

# Example of QSPM in Action

Consider a tech company deciding between two strategies: **Market Expansion** and **Product Development**.

|        | **Total TAS (External)**       | **1.00**   |                       | **3.40** |                          | **2.70** |

---

### Interpretation

In this example:
- **Internal Factors** give **Product Development** a TAS of **3.45**, while **Market Expansion** scores **3.05**.
- **External Factors** give **Market Expansion** a TAS of **3.40**, while **Product Development** scores **2.70**.

**Conclusion**: **Product Development** scores higher for internal factors, while **Market Expansion** scores higher for external factors. Given the overall analysis, the company might choose **Product Development** if it prioritizes internal capabilities, or **Market Expansion** if it focuses on external market growth potential.
