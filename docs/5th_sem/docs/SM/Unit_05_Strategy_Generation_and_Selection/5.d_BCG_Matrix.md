The *BCG Matrix*, developed by the Boston Consulting Group, is a strategic tool used to evaluate an organizationâ€™s product portfolio based on **market growth rate** and **relative market share**. It helps organizations allocate resources and prioritize products for growth, stability, or divestment. The matrix classifies products into four categories:

## 1. Stars
**High Growth, High Market Share**  
Stars are products with a high market share in a rapidly growing market. They often require significant investment to sustain growth but have the potential to become future cash cows.

- **Example**: A leading smartphone model in a growing tech market.
- **Strategy**: Invest to maintain or increase market share.

## 2. Cash Cows
**Low Growth, High Market Share**  
Cash Cows are products with a high market share in a slow-growing or mature market. These products generate steady profits with little investment, often funding other segments.

- **Example**: A popular soft drink brand in a mature beverage market.
- **Strategy**: Maximize profit and use cash flow to support Stars and Question Marks.

## 3. Question Marks
**High Growth, Low Market Share**  
Question Marks are products in a growing market but with low market share. They require substantial investment to increase market share and may have the potential to become Stars, or they could fail.

- **Example**: A new product entering a competitive, fast-growing market.
- **Strategy**: Invest selectively or consider divestment based on potential.

## 4. Dogs
**Low Growth, Low Market Share**  
Dogs are products with low market share in a slow-growing market. They typically generate little profit and may be considered for divestment to free up resources.

- **Example**: An outdated tech gadget in a declining market.
- **Strategy**: Divest or minimize investment to focus on more profitable products.
