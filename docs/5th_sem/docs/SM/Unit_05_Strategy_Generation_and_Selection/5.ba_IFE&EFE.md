# IFE/EFE Matrix

## Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) Matrix

The **IFE Matrix** is a strategic tool used to analyze internal strengths and weaknesses of a business to assess its internal strategic position.

### Steps to Develop an IFE Matrix

1. **List Key Internal Factors:** Identify 10-20 internal factors, including both **strengths** and **weaknesses**. These should be specific and backed by data (e.g., percentages, ratios) where possible.
2. **Assign Weights:** Assign a weight between **0.0** and **1.0** to each factor, reflecting its importance in the industry. The total weight across all factors should equal **1.0**.
3. **Assign Ratings:** Assign a **1-to-4 rating** to each factor:
   - **1** = Major Weakness
   - **2** = Minor Weakness
   - **3** = Minor Strength
   - **4** = Major Strength
4. **Calculate Weighted Scores:** Multiply each factor's weight by its rating.
5. **Calculate Total Weighted Score:** Sum the weighted scores to determine the overall internal position of the organization.

### Example IFE Matrix for a Retail Computer Store

| Key Internal Factors                     | Weight | Rating | Weighted Score |
|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Strengths**                            |        |        |                |
| 1. High inventory turnover rate          | 0.05   | 3      | 0.15           |
| 2. Increase in average customer purchase | 0.07   | 4      | 0.28           |
| 3. Strong brand reputation               | 0.06   | 4      | 0.24           |

| 9. High level of customer satisfaction   | 0.05   | 4      | 0.20           |
| 10. Strong financial position            | 0.06   | 4      | 0.24           |
| **Weaknesses**                           |        |        |                |
| 1. Decline in software sales revenue     | 0.07   | 2      | 0.14           |
| 2. Location impacted by new highway      | 0.08   | 2      | 0.16           |
| 3. Limited social media presence         | 0.04   | 1      | 0.04           |

### Interpreting the IFE Matrix

- **Scores above 2.5** indicate a strong internal position.
- **Scores below 2.5** indicate potential internal weaknesses.
- In this example, a **2.48** score suggests the business is close to an average internal position with room for improvement.

## External Factor Evaluation (EFE) Matrix

The **EFE Matrix** helps summarize and evaluate the external opportunities and threats impacting an organization, providing insight into the organization’s external strategic position.

### Steps to Develop an EFE Matrix

1. **List Key External Factors:** Identify 10-20 external factors, including **opportunities** and **threats**.
2. **Assign Weights:** Assign a weight between **0.0** and **1.0** to each factor based on its importance in the industry. The total weight should equal **1.0**.
3. **Assign Ratings:** Assign a **1-to-4 rating** to each factor based on the effectiveness of the firm’s response:
   - **1** = Poor response
   - **2** = Average response
   - **3** = Above-average response
   - **4** = Superior response
4. **Calculate Weighted Scores:** Multiply each factor's weight by its rating.
5. **Calculate Total Weighted Score:** Sum the weighted scores for an overall external position score.

### Example EFE Matrix for a Local Cinema

| Key External Factors                    | Weight | Rating | Weighted Score |
|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Opportunities**                       |        |        |                |

| 3. Increase in local tourism            | 0.06   | 3      | 0.18           |
| 4. Partnerships with local businesses   | 0.04   | 3      | 0.12           |
| 5. Demand for premium cinema experience | 0.07   | 4      | 0.28           |
| 6. Growth of family-friendly events     | 0.03   | 3      | 0.09           |

| 8. Community interest in film festivals | 0.04   | 3      | 0.12           |
| 9. Increasing disposable income         | 0.06   | 3      | 0.18           |
| 10. Potential for streaming partnerships| 0.05   | 4      | 0.20           |
| **Threats**                             |        |        |                |
| 1. Trend towards healthy lifestyle      | 0.05   | 2      | 0.10           |
| 2. Growing demand for streaming services| 0.07   | 1      | 0.07           |

| 10. Potential labor shortages           | 0.05   | 2      | 0.10           |
| **Total**                               | 1.00   |        | **2.52**       |

### Interpreting the EFE Matrix

- **Scores above 2.5** suggest that the firm is effectively responding to external factors.
- **Scores below 2.5** indicate challenges in addressing external threats or capitalizing on opportunities.
- In this example, a score of **2.52** indicates a slightly above-average response to external factors.

By using both IFE and EFE matrices, organizations can develop a well-rounded view of their strategic position. This understanding helps in formulating strategies that leverage internal strengths, address weaknesses, capitalize on external opportunities, and mitigate threats.
