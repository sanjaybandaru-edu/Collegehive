# Vision and Mission Analysis

## Vision Statement

### Definition and Purpose

A **Vision Statement** answers the question, "What do we want to become?" It reflects the long-term aspirations of an organization and provides the foundation for developing mission statements. The vision statement is forward-looking, motivating, and inspirational, aiming to bring benefits and improvements to the organization in the future. It should be concise, preferably one sentence, and written from a customer perspective.

### Characteristics of a Good Vision Statement

- **Forward-Looking**: It sets a future-oriented goal for the organization.
- **Motivating and Inspirational**: It inspires employees and stakeholders to work towards the envisioned future.
- **Reflective of Core Values**: It embodies the organization's culture and core values.
- **Concise and Clear**: It should be short, ideally one sentence, and easily understood by all stakeholders.
- **Customer-Focused**: It considers the organization's role from the perspective of its customers.

### Biblical Reference

Proverbs 29:18 states, "Where there is no vision, the people perish." This verse is often used to emphasize the importance of vision in leadership, suggesting that without a long-term plan or vision, people are doomed to wander aimlessly.

## Mission Statement

### Definition and Purpose

A **Mission Statement** answers the question, "What is our business?" It describes the organization's reason for existence, outlining its purpose, intentions, and overall objectives. The mission statement supports the vision and serves as a communication tool to convey purpose and direction to employees, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders.

### Characteristics of a Good Mission Statement

- **Descriptive**: It clearly explains the organization's purpose and what it seeks to achieve.
- **Guiding**: It charts the future direction and reminds employees why the company exists and what the founders envisioned.
- **Values-Oriented**: It describes the values and priorities of the organization.
- **Comprehensive**: A good mission statement reveals the nine basic components of the organization, such as products/services, markets, technology, concern for survival, philosophy, self-concept, concern for public image, and concern for employees.

### Illustrative Story

Former Porsche CEO Peter Schultz once shared a story from a construction site where workers were asked about their jobs. The answers varied:
- "Breaking rocks," said the first.
- "Earning a living," replied the second.
- "Helping to build a cathedral," said the third.

**Moral of the Story**: The story illustrates that few can build cathedrals, but those who see the larger purpose in their work—those who align with a clear vision and mission—find more meaning and fulfillment in their tasks.
