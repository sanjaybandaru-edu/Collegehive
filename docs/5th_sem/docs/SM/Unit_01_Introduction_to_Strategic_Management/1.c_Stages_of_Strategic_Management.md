Strategic management is a process that involves the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of cross-functional decisions that enable an organization to achieve its objectives. The strategic management process is divided into three key stages:

## 1. Strategy Formulation

**Strategy formulation** involves:

- **Developing a Vision and Mission**: Establishing the organization's long-term direction and purpose.
- **Identifying External Opportunities and Threats**: Analyzing the external environment to understand factors that could benefit or threaten the organization.
- **Determining Internal Strengths and Weaknesses**: Assessing the organization's internal capabilities and limitations.
- **Establishing Long-Term Objectives**: Defining specific results the organization aims to achieve over a longer period.
- **Generating Alternative Strategies**: Creating different approaches the organization could take to achieve its objectives.
- **Choosing a Strategy**: Selecting the most appropriate strategy that aligns with the organization's vision and mission.

### Key Issues in Strategy Formulation

Strategic managers must make critical decisions, such as:

- Which new business to enter or which business to abandon?
- Whether to expand operations or diversify into new areas?
- Whether to enter international markets?
- Whether to merge with or form a joint venture with another company?
- How to avoid a hostile takeover?

### Examples of External Opportunities and Threats

- **Opportunities**:

  - Availability of capital.
  - Increasing demand for green products.
  - Growth in global markets.
- **Threats**:

  - Rising interest rates.
  - Intense price competition.
  - Social media networks rapidly expanding.
  - National and global crises like wars or economic downturns.

## 2. Strategy Implementation

**Strategy implementation** is the process of executing the strategies formulated. It is often referred to as the "action stage" and is considered the most challenging part of strategic management.

### Key Steps in Strategy Implementation

- **Establishing Objectives**: Setting specific, actionable goals that need to be achieved to implement the strategy.
- **Devising Policies**: Creating guidelines, rules, and procedures to facilitate the execution of strategies.
- **Motivating Employees**: Ensuring that the organization's workforce is aligned with the strategic goals and motivated to achieve them.

### Importance of Interpersonal Skills

Interpersonal skills are critical in the implementation stage, as they help in effectively managing people, fostering teamwork, and ensuring alignment with strategic objectives.

## 3. Strategy Evaluation

**Strategy evaluation** is the final stage of the strategic management process. It involves three fundamental activities:

- **Reviewing External and Internal Factors**: Continuously assessing the external and internal factors that were the basis for the current strategies to ensure they remain relevant.
- **Measuring Performance**: Evaluating the organization's performance against the set objectives to determine the effectiveness of the strategy.
- **Taking Corrective Action**: Making necessary adjustments to strategies based on performance outcomes and changes in the external or internal environment.

In large organizations, these stages occur at three hierarchical levels:

- **Corporate Level**: Top management focuses on the overall direction and strategy of the organization.
- **Divisional or Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Level**: Middle management develops strategies for specific divisions or SBUs.
- **Functional Level**: Functional managers ensure that departmental strategies align with the overall strategic goals of the organization.
