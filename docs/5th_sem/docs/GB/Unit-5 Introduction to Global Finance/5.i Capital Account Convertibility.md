# Capital Account Convertibility (CAC)

Capital Account Convertibility refers to the freedom to convert local financial assets into foreign financial assets and vice versa at market-determined exchange rates. This feature of a nation's financial regime allows the local currency to be exchanged for foreign currency without restrictions on the amount, facilitating easier cross-border capital movement.

## Definition and Overview

Capital account convertibility is sometimes referred to as "capital asset liberation." It signifies a regime where there are no limitations on the amounts of local currency that can be converted into foreign currency and vice versa. Full capital account convertibility aims to make the flow of international capital as frictionless as possible.

## Key Tenets of Capital Account Convertibility

Capital account convertibility is based on several principles designed to ensure the smooth functioning of international capital markets:

### 1. **Free Exchange of Liquid Assets**

- **Description**: All types of liquid assets should be freely exchangeable between any two nations globally, using standardized exchange rates.
- **Objective**: This principle aims to promote global financial integration and ease the process of cross-border asset transactions.

### 2. **Transaction Amounts**

- **Threshold**: Transactions under CAC should involve significant amounts, typically in excess of $500,000.
- **Purpose**: This stipulation helps to maintain the focus on substantial investment flows, rather than routine or minor exchanges, which might not impact the broader economy.

### 3. **Investment in Semi-Liquid Assets**

- **Investment Strategy**: Capital inflows obtained through CAC should be primarily invested in semi-liquid assets.
- **Rationale**: The aim is to prevent potential negative economic impacts such as market churning or excessive capital outflows that could destabilize the local economy.

### 4. **Regulation on Institutional Investors**

- **Guideline**: Institutional investors are advised not to use CAC as a tool to manipulate fiscal policies or exchange rates.
- **Enforcement**: Ensuring that CAC is used responsibly involves regulatory oversight to prevent misuse by large players in the financial markets.

### 5. **Buffering by National Banks**

- **Management of Flows**: Excessive inflows and outflows of capital should be managed and buffered by national banks.
- **Collateral Provision**: These banks may provide collateral to stabilize the market in situations where rapid capital movements might otherwise lead to financial instability.

Capital Account Convertibility is a critical aspect of modern financial systems, facilitating the free movement of capital across borders. While it offers numerous benefits in terms of investment and economic flexibility, it also requires careful regulation to prevent abuse and ensure that it contributes positively to the global financial stability.
