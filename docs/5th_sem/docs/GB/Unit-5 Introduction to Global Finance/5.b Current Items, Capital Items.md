# Current and Capital Items: An Overview

## Current Account

The Current Account is a key indicator of an economy's foreign trade where it records all transactions related to goods, services, income, and current transfers between domestic and foreign residents. The balance of the current account indicates a nation's net income over a period.

### Components of the Current Account

- **Exports as Credits**: Represents the value of all goods and services sold to foreign entities. Exports are a fundamental component of a country's economic output and are critical for earning foreign exchange.
- **Imports as Debits**: Reflects the value of goods and services purchased from abroad. Imports are subtracted from exports to determine the trade balance.
- **Net Income**: Includes earnings from investments and salaries from abroad minus payments made to foreign investors and workers.
- **Balance of Visible and Invisible Items**:
  - **Visible Items**: Consist of all tangible goods traded between countries.
  - **Invisible Items**: Encompass services such as financial services, insurance, and tourism, along with earnings on investments and transfers like remittances.

The Current Account balance can be a surplus or a deficit, indicating whether a country is a net lender or borrower in the global economy.

## Capital Account

The Capital Account records all transactions between residents and non-residents that cause a change in ownership of national assets. It includes the transfer of money and other capital items and is crucial for understanding the financial flows affecting the national economy.

### Components of the Capital Account

- **Transfers of Money and Other Capital Items**: Involves significant acquisitions or disposals of assets such as real estate or business investments.
- **Increase in Gross External Debt**: Refers to borrowing from foreign lenders which can be used to finance large projects or cover budget deficits.
- **Deployment of Resources Productively**: This aspect emphasizes how the funds acquired through the capital account are used to enhance the country's productive capacity.
- **Enhance Ability to Repay**: Proper deployment of resources should ideally lead to economic growth, which in turn increases a country's ability to repay external debt.

The Capital Account is essential for showing how capital moves in and out of a country, particularly in forms that are not captured by the Current Account.


Understanding the distinction and the interplay between the Current and Capital Accounts helps in assessing a nation's economic health and its positions within the global economic landscape. A healthy balance between these accounts reflects stable economic management and promising economic growth prospects.
