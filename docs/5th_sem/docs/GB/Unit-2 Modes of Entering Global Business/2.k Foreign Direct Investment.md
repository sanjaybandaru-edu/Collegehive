Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) refers to the investment made by a company or individual in one country in business interests in another country, in the form of either establishing business operations or acquiring business assets in the foreign country, including ownership or controlling interest in a foreign company.

FDI is a key indicator of international economic integration, serving as a bridge to transfer capital, skills, and technology from developed to developing countries, and plays a pivotal role in the global economic landscape.

## Types of FDI

FDI can be broadly categorized into two types:

- **Horizontal FDI**: Where a business expands its domestic operations to a foreign country.
- **Vertical FDI**: Involves a company moving a part of or all its operations to a foreign country.

## Modes of FDI

There are several ways through which FDI can be made:

1. **By Acquiring Shares**: Directly purchasing shares in a foreign company.
2. **Mergers and Acquisitions**: Joining with or acquiring a foreign company.
3. **Starting New Subsidiaries or Affiliates**: Establishing new operations or branches in the foreign country.
4. **Joint Ventures**: Partnering with foreign companies to create a new entity.

## Advantages of FDI

- **Economic Growth**: Stimulates growth in the host country through job creation and economic diversification.
- **Technology Transfer**: Facilitates the transfer of new technologies and skills to the host country.
- **Infrastructure Development**: Often involves improvements in infrastructure, which can benefit the host country's economy.
- **Access to International Markets**: Provides companies with a platform to enter global markets more easily.

## Disadvantages of FDI

- **Political Risks**: Changes in political climate or policies in the host country can impact investments.
- **Economic Dependence**: Host countries may become too dependent on foreign investments.
- **Negative Impact on Domestic Firms**: Domestic companies may struggle to compete with larger, foreign companies.
- **Repatriation of Profits**: Profits generated by the foreign investment are often sent back to the investor's home country, which may not benefit the host country's economy in the long term.



FDI is a double-edged sword that offers significant benefits to both the investor and the host country but also poses challenges and risks. Understanding the mechanisms, advantages, and potential drawbacks of FDI is crucial for policymakers and business leaders to navigate the complexities of international investments.
