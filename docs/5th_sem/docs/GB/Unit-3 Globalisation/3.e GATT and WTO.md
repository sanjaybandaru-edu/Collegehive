The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was a foundational treaty instituted to regulate international trade by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers. Initiated by 123 nations in Geneva on October 30, 1947, and coming into effect on January 1, 1948, GATT played a pivotal role in the post-war economic recovery and expansion of global trade for nearly half a century.

## Key Components of GATT

GATT encompassed two primary elements:

1. **An International Agreement:** A document outlining the rules for international trade, aiming to promote economic cooperation and reduce trade barriers among nations.
2. **An International Organization:** Created subsequently to support and enforce the agreement, although it lacked a formalized institutional structure compared to its successor, the WTO.

## Transition to WTO

The transition from GATT to WTO marked a significant evolution in global trade regulation, addressing the limitations of GATT and expanding the scope to include not only trade in goods but also services and intellectual property rights. The WTO emerged as a more structured and legally binding international institution with comprehensive mechanisms for dispute resolution and trade policy review.

### Relationship Between GATT and WTO

- **Scope of Trade:** GATT primarily focused on trade in goods, while the WTO covers trade in goods (GATT 1994), services (General Agreement on Trade in Services - GATS), and intellectual property rights (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights - TRIPS).
- **Institutional Structure:** GATT functioned as a provisional set of rules with its participants referred to as "contracting parties." In contrast, the WTO has a well-defined institutional framework, with members that have ratified the WTO agreements, providing it with a solid legal basis.
- **Dispute Settlement:** The WTO introduced a more efficient and automatic dispute settlement system, a significant improvement over the slower and less enforceable GATT system.

### GATT 1947 vs. GATT 1994

The original GATT (1947) agreements have been integrated into the WTO framework but continue to exist under the guise of GATT 1994. This new iteration incorporates the principles of non-discrimination and transparency, extending them to services and intellectual property in addition to goods.

## WTO's Advancements Over GATT

- **Permanency:** The WTO is a permanent institution, unlike the provisional nature of GATT.
- **Membership:** The WTO's membership implies a deeper commitment to abide by its rules and regulations, whereas GATT's parties were not bound by a formal ratification process.
- **Legal and Institutional Framework:** The WTO's agreements provide a comprehensive guide on its functioning, establishing a stronger legal and organizational structure.
- **Trade Policy Review Mechanism:** This innovation under the WTO enhances the transparency of members' trade policies and practices, an aspect absent in GATT.

## Conclusion

The evolution from GATT to WTO represents a significant milestone in the history of international trade. While GATT laid the foundational principles of free trade, the WTO has built upon and expanded these principles, offering a more robust framework for addressing the complexities of modern global trade. The transition underscores the international community's commitment to fostering an open and equitable trading system.
