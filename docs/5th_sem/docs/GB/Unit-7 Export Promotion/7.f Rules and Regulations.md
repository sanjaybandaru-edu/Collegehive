# Rules and Regulations of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India is regulated by the **Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999** and the **Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 (NDI Rules)**. The **Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)** under the Ministry of Commerce issues the Consolidated FDI Policy, which provides sector-specific guidelines for FDI.

## Key Aspects of FDI Regulations in India

### 1. Entry Routes for FDI
FDI can enter the Indian market through two primary routes:

- **Automatic Route**: 
  - Foreign investment does **not require prior approval** from the government. 
  - Sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and IT services are generally open under this route.
  
- **Government Route**: 
  - Investment in these sectors **requires prior approval** from the relevant ministry or department.
  - Sensitive sectors, such as defense and telecommunications, often fall under this route.

### 2. Sectoral Caps and Conditions
- The FDI policy places **limits (caps) on foreign investment in various sectors**. These caps define the maximum percentage of ownership allowed for foreign investors.
- **Examples of Sectoral Caps**:
  - **Agriculture and Manufacturing**: 100% FDI is permitted under the automatic route.
  - **Defense**: FDI is capped at 74% under the automatic route and can go up to 100% with government approval.
- For a comprehensive list, refer to the latest **Consolidated FDI Policy** on the [Invest India](https://www.investindia.gov.in/foreign-direct-investment) website.

### 3. Prohibited Sectors
Certain sectors are **completely closed to FDI** to protect national interests. These include:

  - Atomic energy
  - Lottery businesses
  - Gambling and betting
  - Chit funds
  - Nidhi companies (mutual benefit finance companies)
  - Real estate businesses (excluding construction development)
  - Tobacco product manufacturing

### 4. Recent Amendments
- **Cross-Border Share Swaps**: In August 2024, the Department of Economic Affairs simplified cross-border share swaps, allowing Indian companies to issue or transfer equity in exchange for foreign company equity. This change aims to promote cross-border investment flexibility. [Source: Press Information Bureau](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2046086)

### 5. Special Requirements for Bordering Countries
- **Investments from countries sharing land borders with India** (e.g., China, Pakistan, Bangladesh) require government approval regardless of the investment amount.
- This policy prevents **opportunistic takeovers** of Indian companies, especially during economic downturns, and safeguards **national security**.

### 6. Compliance and Reporting
Foreign investors must comply with regulations concerning pricing, payment modes, and reporting, which are closely monitored by the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**.

- **Pricing Guidelines**: Investments must follow fair market valuations, certified by a chartered accountant or merchant banker.
- **Reporting Requirements**: Investments must be reported to the RBI within 30 days of issuance or transfer of shares.
- For detailed instructions, consult the RBI’s [Master Directions on FDI](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_viewmasdirections.aspx?id=11200).

### 7. Performance-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
The Indian government has launched the **PLI scheme** to attract FDI in sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles by offering **financial incentives** based on performance metrics like sales and exports. This initiative encourages multinational corporations to establish manufacturing units in India, aiming to make the country a **global manufacturing hub**.
