# Rights Issue

A rights issue is an offering of additional shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. Shareholders have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the newly issued shares at a predetermined price. It is a way for companies to raise capital from their existing investor base.

## Key Points about Rights Issue:

- **Proportional Offering:** In a rights issue, the company offers new shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their current ownership. This means that if you own a certain percentage of the company before the rights issue, you have the opportunity to purchase the same percentage of the newly issued shares.

- **Preservation of Ownership:** Rights issues allow existing shareholders to maintain their proportional ownership in the company. This can be appealing to shareholders as it prevents dilution of their ownership stake.

- **Optional Participation:** Shareholders are not obligated to participate in a rights issue. They can choose to exercise their rights by purchasing additional shares or they can sell their rights to other investors.

- **Source of Capital:** Companies use rights issues as a way to raise capital. The funds generated from the sale of the new shares can be used for various purposes, including expansion, debt reduction, or general corporate needs.

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Companies must adhere to regulatory requirements when conducting a rights issue, including providing shareholders with detailed information about the offering and the opportunity to exercise their rights.

Both private placements and rights issues are mechanisms that companies use to access capital, but they serve different purposes and target different types of investors.
