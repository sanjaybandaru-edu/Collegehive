# Leasing

Leasing refers to a contractual arrangement where one party (the lessee) obtains the right to use an asset from another party (the lessor) for a specified period, in exchange for periodic payments. This arrangement is common in scenarios where acquiring the asset outright may be financially prohibitive. Leasing is particularly common with assets like real estate, vehicles, and equipment.

<!-- ## Key Points

- **Contractual Agreement:** Leasing involves a contractual agreement that specifies the terms and conditions under which the lessee can use the asset.

- **Ownership:** The ownership of the asset remains with the lessor, while the lessee gets the right to use it.

- **Duration:** The lease agreement is for a specified duration, at the end of which the asset is returned to the lessor unless there's an option to purchase or renew the lease.

- **Periodic Payments:** The lessee is required to make periodic payments to the lessor as per the terms of the lease agreement.

- **Maintenance and Repairs:** Often, the lessee is responsible for the maintenance and repairs of the leased asset, though this may vary based on the agreement.

## Disadvantages

- **Long-term Expense:** Over time, the cost of leasing can exceed the cost of buying, especially with long-term leases.
- **No Equity:** Leasing doesn't build equity in the asset; at the end of the lease term, you either return the asset or buy it at market value.
- **Limited Control:** Lessees may face restrictions on how they can use the asset, as dictated by the lease agreement.
- **Early Termination Penalties:** Terminating a lease early can result in hefty penalties.
- **Dependent on Credit:** Similar to loans, leases require good credit, and individuals or businesses with poor credit may face higher rates or may not qualify for a lease.
- **Potential for Additional Costs:** There could be additional costs for exceeding mileage on a vehicle lease, wear and tear, or other terms specified in the lease agreement. -->
