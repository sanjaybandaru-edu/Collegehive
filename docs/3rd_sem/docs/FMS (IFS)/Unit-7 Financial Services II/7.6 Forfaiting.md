# Forfaiting

Forfaiting is a financing technique used in international trade where exporters sell their receivables to a forfaiter at a discount in exchange for immediate cash. This method is particularly useful in transactions involving large sums and longer credit terms.

1. **Agreement**: The exporter and importer enter into a trade agreement where the exporter agrees to sell goods to the importer under deferred payment terms.

2. **Delivery of Goods - Export**: The exporter ships the goods to the importer as per the agreement.

3. **Agreement with the Bank for Negotiable Instrument**: The importer, to fulfill the payment obligation, arranges for a negotiable instrument such as a promissory note (PN) or bill of exchange (BOE) through their bank. This serves as a formal promise to pay the amount due on the agreed date.

4. **Delivery of BOE/PNs with Guarantee from the Importerâ€™s Bank**: The importer's bank provides a guarantee on the BOE or PN, backing the importer's promise to pay. This guarantee increases the creditworthiness of the payment promise.

5. **Forfaitor Agreement**: The exporter enters into an agreement with a forfaiter, a specialized finance firm, to sell the receivables that are due from the importer.

6. **Sale of Export Bills**: The exporter sells the BOE or PN to the forfaiter, often at a discount. This sale is without recourse, meaning the exporter is no longer responsible for the credit risk associated with the importer's payment.

7. **Advance Payment**: The forfaiter provides an advance payment to the exporter. This payment is typically a percentage of the face value of the receivables, allowing the exporter to receive immediate cash and improve their cash flow.

8. **Presentation of Bills on Maturity**: On the maturity date of the BOE or PN, the forfaiter presents these instruments to the importer or the importer's bank for payment.

9. **Payment of Bills on Maturity**: The importer, or the importer's bank, makes the payment for the full face value of the BOE or PN to the forfaiter on the maturity date, completing the transaction.


## **Characteristics of Forfaiting**

1. **International Focus**: Primarily used in international trade finance.
2. **Large Transactions**: Typically involves high-value exports.
3. **Credit Term**: Offers medium to long-term credit to buyers.
4. **Non-Recourse**: The exporter relinquishes the risk of non-payment by the importer once the receivable is sold to the forfaiter.

## **Forfaiting Process**

1. **Exporter and Importer Agreement**: An exporter sells goods to an importer under a deferred payment agreement.
2. **Sale of Receivables**: The exporter sells the promissory notes or bills of exchange, representing the importer's debt, to a forfaiter.
3. **Discounted Purchase**: The forfaiter buys these receivables at a discount and pays the exporter cash.
4. **Collection**: The forfaiter becomes responsible for collecting the payment from the importer on the due date.

## **Differences from Factoring**

- **Scope**: Forfaiting is specifically used for international trade, while factoring can be domestic or international.
- **Transaction Size**: Forfaiting typically deals with larger transaction sizes compared to factoring.
- **Credit Term**: Involves medium to long-term credits, unlike factoring which is usually for short-term receivables.
- **Recourse**: Forfaiting is generally without recourse, meaning the exporter is not liable if the importer defaults. In factoring, recourse terms can vary.

Forfaiting provides a secure financing option for exporters in international trade, enabling them to transfer the credit risk associated with foreign receivables to a forfaiter. This method is particularly valuable for exporters who wish to improve their cash flow and eliminate the risks associated with international trade receivables.
