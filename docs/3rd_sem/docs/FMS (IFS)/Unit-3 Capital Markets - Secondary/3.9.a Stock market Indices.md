# Stock Market Index and Global Stock Market Indices

Stock market indices play a crucial role in the world of finance, providing insights into market behavior and serving various functions. This discussion covers the functions of stock market indices, categories of holdings excluded from the definition of free float, and an overview of global stock market indices along with the methods used to calculate them.


## Calculation Methodologies for Stock Indices

### Market Capitalization Weighted

1. **Full Market Capitalization Method**: This method determines a stock's weightage in the index by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the market price of each share. Stocks with higher market capitalization have greater influence on the index. Examples include the S&P 500 Index in the USA and S&P CNX Nifty in India.

2. **Free-Float Market Capitalization Method**: This method considers the percentage of shares that are freely available for purchase in the markets. It excludes shares with strategic investments, government holdings, and other restricted shares. This approach reflects the investible market capitalization, which may be lower than the total. It rewards companies with high free float and may marginalize companies with low free float.
