# Commercial Banks
Commercial banks are financial institutions that operate with the primary aim of earning profit. They offer a wide range of banking services to the general public, businesses, and other organizations. These banks are regulated by national banking laws and overseen by financial authorities like the central bank in their respective countries.

Commercial banks are also known as business banks or corporate banks. They are different from investment banks, which primarily deal with raising capital for businesses and governments. Commercial banks are also distinct from central banks, which are responsible for regulating the money supply in the economy.

## Functions of Commercial Banks


1. **Acceptance of Deposits**: Commercial banks accept deposits from the public, which forms the basis of their lending capacity. These deposits can be in various forms, such as savings accounts, current accounts, fixed deposits, etc. Banks pay interest on these deposits, with rates often determined by regulatory authorities like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

2. **Lending of Funds**: One of the primary functions of commercial banks is to provide loans and advances to individuals, businesses, and other entities. This lending can take various forms, including overdrafts, cash credits, and term loans. The interest charged on these loans forms a significant part of a bank's revenue.

3. **Cheque Facilities**: Banks offer cheque facilities to their account holders, allowing them to make payments and withdrawals without needing hard cash. Cheques can be of different types, such as bearer cheques, which are cashable immediately, and crossed cheques, which need to be credited to the payee's account. This system is an integral part of the credit mechanism in the economy.

4. **Remittance of Funds**: Commercial banks also facilitate the transfer of money. They provide services like issuing drafts, pay orders, and enabling electronic transfers through systems like NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) and RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement). These services are typically provided for a nominal fee and are essential for both personal and business financial transactions.

Overall, commercial banks are fundamental to the functioning of a modern economy, providing necessary financial services that enable both savings and investments, facilitating daily transactions, and contributing to the overall financial stability and growth of a country.
