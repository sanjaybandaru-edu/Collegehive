Commercial banks are the most common type of financial institutions. They accept deposits and provide security and convenience to their customers. By accepting deposits, they mobilize savings in the economy.In India, private sector banks are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
