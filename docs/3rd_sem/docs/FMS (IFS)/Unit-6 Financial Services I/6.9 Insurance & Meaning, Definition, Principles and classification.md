# Insurance

Insurance is a financial arrangement that provides protection against financial loss or risk. It's a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual or entity receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company.

> According to D.S. Hansell, "Insurance is a social device providing financial compensation for the effects of misfortune, the payments being made from the accumulated contributions of all parties participating in the scheme."

## Principles:
Insurance operates on several fundamental principles:

1. **Principle of Indemnity:**  It states that insurance is a mechanism to provide compensation for the loss, and not to make a profit from the event.
   
2. **Principle of Insurable Interest:** The insured must have a financial interest in the subject matter of insurance.
   
3. **Principle of Utmost Good Faith:**  Both the insured and the insurer are required to disclose all material facts honestly.
   
4. **Principle of Subrogation:**   After a loss is paid, the insurer steps into the shoes of the insured to recover the amount of loss from the third party responsible for the loss.
   
5. **Principle of Contribution:**   If more than one insurance policy covers the risk, each insurer contributes to the loss in proportion to the sum insured.
   
6. **Principle of Proximate Cause:**   The cause of loss must be covered under the insurance policy, and the loss must be proximately caused by the insured peril.

7. **Principle of Loss Minimization:**   The insured must take all reasonable steps to minimize the loss.

## Classification:
Insurance can be classified into various categories based on different criteria:
