# Reforms in the Financial System

## Background

The pre-reforms period, spanning from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, was characterized by administered interest rates, industrial licensing and controls, a dominant public sector, and limited competition in the Indian economy. This resulted in inefficient production systems with high costs, an inefficient allocation of resources, and high capital-output ratios. Despite increased saving rates, India remained heavily reliant on foreign aid. During this period, India's growth rate averaged less than 4% per annum, while many other developing countries achieved higher growth rates.

In the early 1990s, India faced a foreign exchange crisis due to rising world oil prices and a drop in remittances. This crisis highlighted the need for economic reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and accelerate economic growth.

## Objectives of Economic Reforms

The government initiated economic reforms in June 1991 with two primary objectives:

1. **Reorientation of the Economy:** Transition from a statist, state-dominated, and highly controlled economy to a market-friendly one. This involved reducing direct controls, physical planning, and trade barriers.

2. **Macro-economic Stability:** Achieving macroeconomic stability by reducing fiscal deficits and the government's dependence on society's savings.

## Reforms in the Financial System

The Indian government recognized the importance of an efficient financial system to support economic reforms. The reforms in the financial system included:

- Liberalization of domestic investment.
- Opening key infrastructure sectors to private sector participation.
- Opening the economy to foreign competition by reducing import controls and tariffs.
- Deregulation of interest rates.
- Encouraging direct foreign investment for technology upgradation and non-debt finance.
- Public sector reform to enhance efficiency.
- Disinvestment of public sector undertakings (PSUs).
- Tax system reform to broaden the tax base and moderate tax rates.

## The Narasimham Committee

In August 1991, the Indian government established a high-level committee chaired by M. Narasimham, a former RBI governor, to examine various aspects of the financial system and recommend comprehensive reforms. The committee submitted its report in November 1991, which included recommendations for reforming both the banking sector and financial markets. These recommendations were gradually implemented in 1992.

- Being closed, highly regulated, and government-controlled.
- Lack of integration and segmentation.
- Limited pricing freedom.
