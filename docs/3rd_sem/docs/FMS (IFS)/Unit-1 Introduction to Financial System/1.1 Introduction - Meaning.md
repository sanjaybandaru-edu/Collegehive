## Key Elements of the Financial System

1. **Financial Institutions:** These are organizations that provide financial services to individuals, businesses, and governments. Key financial institutions include commercial banks, investment banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and pension funds.

2. **Financial Markets:** Financial markets are platforms where buyers and sellers come together to trade financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. Examples of financial markets include stock exchanges, bond markets, and foreign exchange markets.

3. **Financial Instruments:** Financial instruments are contracts or documents representing a financial asset. Common financial instruments include stocks, bonds, mortgages, derivatives, and certificates of deposit (CDs).

4. **Financial Intermediaries:** These institutions act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers, facilitating the transfer of funds from one party to another. Examples of financial intermediaries include banks, credit unions, and mutual funds.

5. **Regulatory Authorities:** Governments establish regulatory bodies to oversee and regulate the financial system. These authorities set rules and regulations to ensure the stability, fairness, and transparency of financial markets and institutions.

6. **Central Banks:** Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, play a critical role in controlling the money supply, setting interest rates, and maintaining financial stability within a country.
