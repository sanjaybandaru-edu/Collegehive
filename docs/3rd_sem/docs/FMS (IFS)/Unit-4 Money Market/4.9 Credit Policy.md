# Credit Policy
## **Definition of Credit Policy**
- A credit policy is a set of rules and standards that govern how companies grant credit to customers and handle collections.
- It outlines credit terms, creditworthiness assessments, cash discounts, credit limits, collection procedures, and customer information management.

## **Types of Credit Policy**
1. **Liberal or Lenient Credit Policy:**
   - Imposes fewer restrictions on credit terms, attracting more customers and increasing sales.
   - Can lead to higher bad debts and liquidity issues.

2. **Restrictive or Tight Policy:**
   - Has strict terms for extending credit to customers.
   - Selective in granting credit, which may result in a loss of customers but ensures consistent cash flow.

## **Elements of Credit Policy (6Cs):**
1. **Credit Terms:**
   - Define payment duration for customers.
   - Example: "Net 30" rule for new customers, extended terms for loyal customers.
   - Strict credit terms may reduce sales but lower bad debt expenses and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).

2. **Creditworthiness of the Customer:**
   - Evaluate the creditworthiness of customers to assess their likelihood of default.
   - Existing customers may have a positive credit history, while new ones pose higher default risks.

3. **Cash Discounts:**
   - Include discounts to attract customers and reduce DSO.

4. **Credit Limits:**
   - Determine the extended credit period based on creditworthiness.
   - Lower credit scores result in shorter credit limits.

5. **Collection Policy:**
   - Specify collection terms, late fees, and interest payable.
   - Tight collection policies may affect customer relationships and reduce investments in accounts receivables.

6. **Customer Information:**
   - Maintain essential documents and information related to transactions.
   - Helps in assessing and reviewing clients' data.

## **Examples**
- Example #1: A wholesale business sets different credit policies for clients based on their tenure. Longer credit periods are given to older clients, leading to faster repayments and higher sales.
- Example #2: Governments, like the Indian and U.S. Federal governments, can announce changes in credit policies, affecting various economic sectors.
