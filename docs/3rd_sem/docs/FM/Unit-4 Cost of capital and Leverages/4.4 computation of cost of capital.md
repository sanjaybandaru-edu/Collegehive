<!-- Suppose a company issues 2,000 shares with a face value of $100 each, offering an 8% dividend rate. Additionally, the company incurs underwriting costs of 2% and brokerage costs of 1%. Printing and other expenses for the share issuance amount to $2,000. What is the total cost of debt for this share issuance?
Certainly, here's the calculation using MathJax:

To calculate the total cost of debt for this share issuance, we need to consider the cost of the shares themselves, underwriting costs, brokerage costs, and printing/other expenses. We'll use the formula you provided:

\[kdb = \frac{i}{np}\]

Where:
- \(kdb\) is the total cost of debt.
- \(i\) is the interest or dividend rate (8% in this case).
- \(n\) is the face value of each share (\$100).
- \(p\) is the price at which the shares are issued to investors.

Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. Calculate the total face value of the shares issued:
   \[ \text{Total Face Value} = \text{Number of Shares} \times \text{Face Value per Share} \]
   \[ \text{Total Face Value} = 2,000 \text{ shares} \times \$100/\text{share} = \$200,000 \]

2. Calculate the total underwriting costs:
   \[ \text{Underwriting Costs} = \text{Underwriting Percentage} \times \text{Total Face Value} \]
   \[ \text{Underwriting Costs} = 2\% \times \$200,000 = \$4,000 \]

3. Calculate the total brokerage costs:
   \[ \text{Brokerage Costs} = \text{Brokerage Percentage} \times \text{Total Face Value} \]
   \[ \text{Brokerage Costs} = 1\% \times \$200,000 = \$2,000 \]

4. Calculate the total printing and other expenses:
   \[ \text{Printing and Other Expenses} = \$2,000 \text{ (given)} \]

5. Calculate the total cost of shares issued to investors:
   \[ \text{Total Cost of Shares} = \text{Total Face Value} + \text{Underwriting Costs} + \text{Brokerage Costs} + \text{Printing and Other Expenses} \]
   \[ \text{Total Cost of Shares} = \$200,000 + \$4,000 + \$2,000 + \$2,000 = \$208,000 \]

Now, we have the total cost of shares (\(p\)) and the interest rate (\(i\)). Plug these values into the formula to calculate the total cost of debt (\(kdb\)):

\[kdb = \frac{0.08}{\$208,000}\]

Calculating \(kdb\):

\[kdb = \frac{0.08}{\$208,000} \approx 0.0003846\]

Now, we can convert this decimal to a percentage by multiplying by 100:

\[kdb \approx 0.0003846 \times 100 \approx 0.03846\%\]

So, the total cost of debt for this share issuance is approximately 0.03846%. -->
