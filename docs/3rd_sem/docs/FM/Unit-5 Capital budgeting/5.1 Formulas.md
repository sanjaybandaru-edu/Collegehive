# Formula of Capital Budgeting

## Note

For PBP,NPV,PI,IRR, Cash flows are considered after tax but before depreciation.

For ARR, Cash flows are considered after tax and after depreciation.

|Particular|Amount|
|---|---|
|Cash Flow|XXX|
|(-) Depreciation|XXX|
|Cash Flow after Depreciation|XXX|
|(-) Tax|XXX|
|Cash Flow after Tax|XXX (for ARR) |
|(+) Depreciation|XXX|
|Cash Flow after Tax and Depreciation|XXX (for PBP , NPV , PI , IRR)|


## Payback Period

### Uniform Cash Flows

Payback period is the time required to recover the Original investment in a project. It is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{Original Investment}}{\text{Annual Cash Flow}}
\]


### Non-Uniform Cash Flows

When the cash flows are not uniform, the payback period is calculated as follows:


|Years|Cash Inflows|Cumulative Cash Flow|
|---|---|---|
|1|A<sub>1</sub>|A<sub>1</sub>|
|2|A<sub>2</sub>|A<sub>1</sub> + A<sub>2</sub>|
|3|A<sub>3</sub>|A<sub>1</sub> + A<sub>2</sub> + A<sub>3</sub>|
|4|A<sub>4</sub>|A<sub>1</sub> + A<sub>2</sub> + A<sub>3</sub> + A<sub>4</sub>|
|5|A<sub>5</sub>|A<sub>1</sub> + A<sub>2</sub> + A<sub>3</sub> + A<sub>4</sub> + A<sub>5</sub>|


\[\text{Payback Period} = \text{Year before full recovery} + \left(\frac{\text{Unrecovered cost at the beginning of the year}}{\text{Cash flow during the year}}\right)\]

## Net Present Value (NPV)

|Year|Cash Inflow|P/v Factor|Present Value of Cash Inflow|
|---|---|---|--|
|1|A<sub>1</sub>|1/(1+r)|A<sub>1</sub>/(1+r)|
|2|A<sub>2</sub>|1/(1+r)<sup>2</sup>|A<sub>2</sub>/(1+r)<sup>2</sup>|
|3|A<sub>3</sub>|1/(1+r)<sup>3</sup>|A<sub>3</sub>/(1+r)<sup>3</sup>|
|4|A<sub>4</sub>|1/(1+r)<sup>4</sup>|A<sub>4</sub>/(1+r)<sup>4</sup>|
|5|A<sub>5</sub>|1/(1+r)<sup>5</sup>|A<sub>5</sub>/(1+r)<sup>5</sup>|

NPV = Sum of Present Value of Cash Inflows - Original Investment

---

## Profitability Index (PI)

Similar to NPV, but it is expressed as a ratio of present value of cash inflows to the original investment.

PI = Sum of Present Value of Cash Inflows / Original Investment

---

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

Discount Factor = Original Investment / Sum of Present Value of Cash Inflows

\text{IRR} = A + \frac{cC-O}{C-D} \cdot (B - A)

Where:

A = Lower discount rate

B = Higher discount rate

C = Sum of Present Value of Cash Inflows at A

D = Sum of Present Value of Cash Inflows at B

O = Original Investment
