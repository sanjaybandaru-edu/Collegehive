# HR Structure

Human resource (HR) structures within organizations can vary based on the company's size, industry, and specific needs. Here are four common types of HR structures:

1. **Hierarchical Structure:**
    * In a hierarchical HR structure, HR departments are organized in a top-down manner, mirroring the overall organizational hierarchy.
    * HR staff is typically organized by functions such as recruitment, training, compensation, and benefits.
    * This structure is common in large corporations with a formal chain of command.

2. **Functional Structure:**
    * In a functional HR structure, HR departments are organized based on specialized functions.
    * Each HR team focuses on specific HR activities like recruitment, training, or compensation.
    * This structure allows for specialization and expertise in each HR function.

3. **Divisional Structure:**
    * In a divisional HR structure, HR teams are organized by business units, divisions, or geographic locations.
    * Each division or business unit may have its own HR department.
    * This structure is often found in large companies with multiple business units or locations, and it allows HR to cater to the unique needs of each division.

4. **Flat Structure:**
    * A flat HR structure is characterized by minimal layers of hierarchy.
    * HR functions may be decentralized, and HR professionals often work closely with other departments.
    * This structure is common in small to mid-sized companies and startups, promoting a more agile and collaborative HR approach.
