# Work from Home: An Overview

Work from Home (WFH) refers to a working arrangement where employees perform their job duties from their home environment rather than in a traditional office setting. This trend has gained significant traction due to technological advancements that enable remote communication and collaboration, as well as external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated physical distancing.

## The Rise of Work from Home

The concept of WFH has been around for decades, but it was often limited to certain roles or seen as a special privilege. However, with the advent of high-speed internet, cloud computing, and a variety of communication tools, it has become a viable option for many organizations and roles.
