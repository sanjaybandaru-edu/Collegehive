# Types of Incentive Schemes

Incentive schemes are designed to motivate employees and enhance their performance. These schemes can be categorized into individual, group, enterprise, and non-financial incentive schemes, each with its own set of methods and objectives.

## 1. **Individual Incentive Schemes:**
Individual incentive schemes are tailored to individual performance, rewarding employees based on their personal achievements.

### a) Incentives in Proportion to Performance:
   - **Straight Piece-Work (Production):** Employees are paid a fixed rate for each unit produced.
   - **Standard Hour-Plan (Task):** Employees are paid a fixed rate for each hour of work, with bonuses for completing tasks within a shorter time.

### b) Incentives Varying Proportionately Less Than Performance:
   - **Halsey Plan (Task & Time):** Employees are guaranteed a fixed hourly wage, with a bonus for completing tasks in less time than the standard time.
   - **Rowan Premium Plan (Time Spent & Time Saved):** Similar to Halsey but the bonus decreases as the work time exceeds the standard time.
   - **Barth Variable Sharing Plan (Number of Hours):** The hourly rate varies based on efficiency, and the sharing ratio of benefits varies too.
   - **Bedaux Plan (Rate per Hour):** Employees earn a standard rate per hour plus a bonus for exceeding the standard performance.

### c) Incentives Varying Proportionately More Than Performance:
   - **High Piece-Rate System (Output):** A higher rate is paid for each unit produced beyond a certain level.
   - **High Standard Hour System (Time):** A higher hourly rate is paid for work completed in less than the standard time.

### d) Incentives Varying in Proportions That Varies With Levels of Performance:
   - **Taylor's Differential Piece-Rate System (Low & High):** Two different rates are set for below and above standard performance.
   - **Merrick's Multiple Piece-Rate System (3 Piece Rates):** Three piece rates are set for different levels of performance.
   - **Gantt Task and Bonus Plan (Output and Time Standards):** Standard time is set for each task, with bonuses for better performance.
   - **Emerson's Efficiency Plan (Time Efficiency):** Bonuses are given based on the efficiency percentage.
   - **Accelerating Premium System (Standard Output):** The premium increases as the level of output increases.

## 2. **Group Incentive Schemes:**
Group incentive schemes reward a group of employees for collective performance, promoting teamwork and shared responsibility.

## 3. **Enterprise Incentive Schemes:**
Enterprise incentive schemes are organization-wide plans where all employees are eligible for incentives based on the overall performance of the company.

## 4. **Non-Financial Incentive Schemes:**
Non-financial incentive schemes provide recognition, appreciation, opportunities for growth and development, and other non-monetary rewards to motivate employees.

Each type of incentive scheme has its own set of advantages and challenges, and the selection of a particular scheme would depend on the nature of the job, the organizational structure, and the overall goals of the organization.
