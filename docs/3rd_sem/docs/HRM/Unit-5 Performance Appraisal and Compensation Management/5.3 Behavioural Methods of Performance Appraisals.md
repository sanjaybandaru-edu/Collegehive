# Behavioural Methods of Performance Appraisal

Behavioural methods of performance appraisal focus on evaluating the behaviours and actions of employees in their workplace rather than just their traits or end results. These methods are often considered more fair and accurate as they provide a clear picture of an employee’s actual job performance. Here’s an elucidation of various behavioural methods:

## 1. **Behavioural Checklist Method:**
   - In this method, a checklist of behavioural statements relating to the employee’s job is prepared.
   - The rater checks off the statements that are applicable to the employee’s behaviour.
   - This method is relatively easy to use, but the effectiveness largely depends on the quality and inclusivity of the behavioural statements listed.

## 2. **Critical Incident Method:**
   - The Critical Incident Method involves identifying and assessing critical behaviours that contribute to success or failure in the job.
   - The raters are required to record critical incidents of employees’ behaviours related to their job performance over a period.
   - This method provides specific feedback and is helpful for training and development purposes.

## 3. **Anchored Rating Scale (BARS):**
   - The Anchored Rating Scale method, also known as Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS), combines elements of the traditional rating scales and critical incident methods.
   - It involves evaluating employees’ performance against specific behavioural examples anchored to numerical ratings.
   - BARS provides more clear standards and better feedback on performance as compared to traditional rating scales.

## 4. **Behavior Observation Scale (BOS):**
   - BOS requires the rater to rate frequency of specific behaviours exhibited by the employee.
   - Unlike BARS, BOS does not require a judgement of the desirability of the behaviours, making it more objective.
   - It helps in identifying specific areas of strength and weakness in an employee’s performance.

## 5. **Assessment Center:**
   - The Assessment Center method evaluates employees’ potential for a specific type of job.
   - Various exercises like in-basket exercises, role-plays, and simulations are conducted to simulate real job situations.
   - It’s an intensive method often used for selecting and developing managerial personnel.

## 6. **Psychological Appraisal:**
   - Psychological appraisal assesses an employee’s future potential rather than past performance.
   - It involves evaluating individuals’ intrinsic traits like intelligence, motivation, and personality.
   - It’s often conducted by trained psychologists and involves in-depth interviews, psychological tests, and other methods to assess employees.

## 7. 360-Degree Appraisal:
   - The 360-Degree Appraisal collects input from various sources, including subordinates and colleagues, alongside supervisors.
   - Evaluators rate the manager based on specific criteria, like leadership, communication, and teamwork, providing a comprehensive view.
   - Managers are motivated to nurture positive relationships with subordinates and colleagues, fostering a collaborative work atmosphere. 

Each of these behavioural methods has its unique advantages and provides a different lens through which to evaluate employees’ performance and potential. While they might be more time-consuming and require a higher level of rater expertise, behavioural methods often yield more accurate and actionable insights into employee performance. They are particularly useful for complex job roles where performance is not easily quantifiable by numbers or end results. Through these methods, organizations can gain a better understanding of how an employee’s behaviour contributes to their overall job performance and the achievement of organizational goals.
