# Types of Interviews

Employers use various types of interviews to assess candidates and make informed hiring decisions. Each type of interview serves a specific purpose and provides unique insights into a candidate's qualifications and suitability for a job. Here are some common types of interviews:

## 1. Direct Interview

**Direct interviews** involve a straightforward face-to-face interaction between the interviewer and the interviewee. During this interview, the interviewer asks specific questions to assess the candidate's knowledge of the job, attitude, motivation, and personal characteristics. It's a structured format designed to gather information relevant to the job.

## 2. Non-Direct Interview

In a **non-direct interview**, the interviewer takes a more passive role. Instead of asking direct questions, the candidate is encouraged to express their thoughts and opinions on a topic of their choosing. The interviewer mainly listens without interrupting. This approach allows for freedom of expression and helps assess the candidate's personality and communication skills.

## 3. Patterned Interview

In a **patterned interview**, a set of standard questions is prepared in advance. Both the questions and expected answers are predetermined. The interviewer compares the candidate's responses to these pre-determined answers to evaluate their suitability for the job. This structured approach ensures consistency in the evaluation process.

## 4. Stress Interview

A **stress interview** is designed to put the candidate under pressure or in uncomfortable situations. The interviewer may ask challenging or provocative questions to see how the candidate responds. For example, they might inquire about past job terminations or failures. Candidates who handle such questions with composure and professionalism are viewed positively.

## 5. Board or Panel Interview

In a **board or panel interview**, a group of interviewers, typically consisting of multiple panel members, questions the candidate. Each panel member may focus on a specific area of expertise or topic. After the interview, the panel members collaborate to evaluate the candidate's performance based on their individual assessments.

## 6. Group Interview

A **group interview** involves observing a group of candidates engaged in a discussion or problem-solving activity. Employers assess how candidates interact, communicate, and contribute within a group setting. Outstanding performers in group interviews may be considered for the job.

## 7. Exit Interview

An **exit interview** is conducted when an employee is leaving an organization, often in industries like IT with high turnover rates. The purpose is to understand the reasons for the employee's departure. Management may use this information to address issues and potentially offer incentives to retain the employee. If the employee is unsatisfied with the new offer, they may decide to stay with the current organization.

These various types of interviews allow employers to gather diverse information about candidates, assess their suitability for the role, and make well-informed hiring decisions. The choice of interview type depends on the specific goals and requirements of the hiring process.
