# Product Positioning

In simple words, "product positioning" refers to the position or image which a product enjoys in the minds of the present and potential customer. According to Philip Kotler "positioning is the act of designing, the companys offer so that it occupies a distinct and valued place in the target customers minds."

The core thought behind positioning is the idea that your brand/product must occupy a particular space continuously in the consumers mind. It is called renting mind space. i.e., find a suitable space in the mind and sit on it, do not let someone else (rival) to dislodge you.

Positioning is based on some unique selling proposition (USP). It is normally based on some unique feature of the product, brand, some unique feature of the market or some feature of the competition which becomes the core idea and around that feature, the product is placed in the market.

Positioning in the marketplace is a strategic marketing concept that involves how a brand or product is perceived by its target audience relative to competitors. There are various positioning strategies a company can use to establish a unique identity in the market. Here are seven common types of positioning strategies along with examples of real companies that employ them:

1. **Attribute Positioning:**
    * This strategy focuses on highlighting specific product attributes or features that make it stand out.
    * **Example:** Volvo positions itself as a car brand known for safety. Their marketing emphasizes attributes like "Volvo  * For Life."

2. **Benefit Positioning:**
    * This approach emphasizes the benefits or solutions a product provides to customers.
    * **Example:** Colgate toothpaste positions itself as a brand that offers the benefit of "strong teeth and fresh breath."

3. **Use/Application Positioning:**
    * Here, a product is positioned based on its intended use or application.
    * **Example:** WD *40 positions itself as a versatile product that can be used for "lubrication, rust removal, and cleaning."

4. **User Positioning:**
    * This strategy targets specific user groups or demographics.
    * **Example:** Barbie positions its dolls primarily for young girls, while Hot Wheels targets young boys.

5. **Competitor Positioning:**
    * Companies position themselves directly against a specific competitor, highlighting key advantages.
    * **Example:** Pepsi positions itself as a direct competitor to Coca Cola, often using comparative advertising.

6. **Product Category Positioning:**
    * A product is positioned within a specific category, indicating its function or industry.
    * **Example:** Kleenex positions its tissue products within the broader category of "facial tissues."

7. **Quality or Price Positioning:**
    * Brands can position themselves based on perceived quality or pricing compared to competitors.
    * **Example:** Rolex positions itself as a luxury watch brand, emphasizing high *quality craftsmanship. In contrast, Timex positions itself as an affordable, reliable watch brand.

These positioning strategies help companies differentiate themselves in the market, connect with target audiences, and create a unique brand image. Successful positioning can lead to increased market share and brand loyalty.
