# Consumer Actions to Promote Sustainable Marketing

Consumers play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable marketing practices. Their choices and actions can significantly influence how companies operate and market their products. Here, we'll explore consumer actions that promote sustainable marketing, using examples of companies like Nike, UPS, and Intel, and also discuss how environmental sustainability relates to marketing sustainability.

## Consumer Actions

1. **Informed Purchasing**: Consumers can actively seek out and purchase products from companies that use environmentally friendly materials and sustainable practices. For instance, Nike's initiative to make shoes from "environmentally preferred materials" and recycle old sneakers is a response to growing consumer demand for sustainable products.

2. **Supporting Green Initiatives**: By choosing services from companies like UPS, which has developed a "green fleet" of low-emission vehicles, consumers endorse and motivate further green initiatives.

3. **Advocating for Renewable Energy**: Support for companies like Intel, installing solar power systems, highlights consumer approval for renewable energy use in operations, influencing other companies to follow suit.

4. **Demanding Transparency and Accountability**: Consumers increasingly demand transparency about the environmental impact of products. This demand leads to better product stewardship, where companies are responsible for the environmental impacts throughout the product's life cycle.

## Environmental Sustainability vs. Marketing Sustainability

- **Environmental Sustainability**: This involves preserving natural resources and minimizing ecological footprints. It's about developing new clean technologies and creating a strategic framework for future sustainability.

- **Marketing Sustainability**: Goes beyond just the environment. It encompasses both natural and social environments, including ethical and responsible marketing practices, and the overall impact of these practices on society and future generations.

## Traditional Sellers' and Buyers' Rights

- **Sellers' Rights**: Include introducing products, setting prices, promoting products, and using buying incentive programs, with the caveat of ensuring safety and fairness.

- **Buyers' Rights**: Encompass the right to safety, the right to be informed, protection against dubious practices, and the right to influence products and marketing for a better quality of life. 

- **Additional Buyers' Rights**: These extend to being well informed about products, being protected against questionable practices, and the right to consume in a manner that preserves the world for future generations.

## Case Example of Coca-Cola's Sustainability Initiatives

Coca-Cola is actively addressing sustainability challenges through several key initiatives:

1. **Sustainable Packaging**: Recognizing the benefits of aluminum, which can be indefinitely recycled, Coca-Cola continues to use aluminum cans. However, they also face the challenge of plastic bottle waste, as plastic bottles are a primary packaging choice but not as sustainable.

2. **Investment in Recycling**: To tackle plastic waste, Coca-Cola has invested over $60 million in building the world's largest plastic-bottle-to-bottle recycling plant. This facility aims to recycle about 100 million pounds of PET plastic annually.

3. **Alternative Packaging Research**: The company is researching and testing new, sustainable packaging materials like aluminum, corn, and bioplastics.

4. **Eco-Friendly Distribution**: Coca-Cola has invested $40 million in research to develop HFC-free coolers that are more energy-efficient, using 30 to 40 percent less energy.

5. **Water Neutrality Goal**: Coca-Cola is committed to becoming water neutral. This involves reducing water usage in bottling processes and contributing to watershed conservation efforts globally.


Consumer actions have a profound impact on promoting sustainable marketing. By choosing to support environmentally responsible companies, demanding transparency, and advocating for sustainable practices, consumers drive the shift towards a more sustainable and ethical marketplace. This not only influences corporate behavior but also contributes to the preservation of the environment for future generations.
