# Marketing channels

A marketing channel, also known as a distribution channel, refers to the pathway through which goods and services travel from the producer or manufacturer to the end-user or consumer. It includes all the intermediaries involved in this process, such as wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and even the internet.

Marketing channels can be direct, where the company sells directly to the consumer, or indirect, involving various intermediary levels. The choice of marketing channels depends on a variety of factors, including the nature of the product, the market, the company's overall strategy, and consumer preferences.
