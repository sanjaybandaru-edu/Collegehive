# NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)

**Overview**

NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is an intergovernmental military alliance consisting of 30 countries from North America and Europe. Its fundamental goal is to safeguard the freedom and security of its member nations through political and military means. NATO was established in 1949 during the Cold War to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, and it has evolved to address contemporary security challenges, including terrorism, cyberwarfare, and climate change.

## **Collective Defense**

NATO's primary role is collective defense, meaning that if one NATO member is attacked, all other members are obligated to come to its aid. NATO invoked Article 5 of its founding treaty, which outlines this commitment to collective defense, only once in response to the 9/11 attacks on the United States.

## **Additional Activities**

In addition to collective defense, NATO engages in a range of other activities, including:

- Promoting democratic values and good governance.
- Countering terrorism.
