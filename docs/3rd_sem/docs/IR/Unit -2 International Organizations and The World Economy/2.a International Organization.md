# International Organizations

International organizations are entities that are established by two or more countries to achieve common goals. They can be intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), which are composed of government representatives, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which are composed of private citizens.

**IGOs** are the most common type of international organization. They are created by treaties between countries, and their members are typically governments. IGOs have a wide range of purposes, including promoting peace and security, providing humanitarian aid, regulating trade, and protecting the environment.

Some examples of IGOs include:

- The United Nations (UN)
- The World Health Organization (WHO)
- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
- The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- The World Bank

**NGOs** are less formal than IGOs. They are not created by treaties, and their members are typically private citizens or non-profit organizations. NGOs often work on issues that are not covered by IGOs, such as human rights, environmental protection, and poverty alleviation.

Some examples of NGOs include:

- Amnesty International
- Greenpeace
- Oxfam
- Doctors Without Borders
- Save the Children

International organizations play an important role in the global political economy. They can help to promote peace and security, improve the lives of people around the world, and manage global challenges such as climate change and terrorism. However, they also face challenges, such as a lack of funding, bureaucratic inertia, and political interference.

The future of international organizations is uncertain. However, they are likely to continue to play an important role in the global political economy, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected.
