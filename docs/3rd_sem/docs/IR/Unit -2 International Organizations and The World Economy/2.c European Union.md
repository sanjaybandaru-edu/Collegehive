# European Union

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. The union has a total area of 4,233,255 km2 (1,634,469 sq mi) and an estimated total population of over 448 million. The EU has often been described as a sui generis political entity (without precedent or comparison) combining the characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.

The EU was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty—whose main architects were Horst Köhler, Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand—came into force on 1 November 1993. The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred to as such before the treaty. With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993.

The EU's main goals are to promote peace, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe; to foster economic and social progress; and to create a single market in which goods, services, capital, and people can move freely. The EU has achieved many of these goals, and it has become a major force in the global economy.

## EU's institutions

- The European Parliament: The directly elected body of the EU, which represents the citizens of the member states.
- The European Council: The heads of state or government of the member states, which sets the overall political direction of the EU.

The EU has a single currency, the euro, which is used by 19 member states. The EU also has a common foreign and security policy, and it is a major player in international affairs.

The EU is a complex and evolving organization, and it has been the subject of much debate and controversy. However, there is no doubt that it has been a major force for peace and prosperity in Europe.
