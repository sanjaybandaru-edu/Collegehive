# Realism

## Meaning
Realism is a theory of international relations that emphasizes the self-interested pursuit of power and security by states in an anarchic world.


Realism argues that states are the primary actors in international relations, and they act to maximize their own interests. Anarchy, the absence of a world government, leads to competition, conflict, and self-help behavior. States seek to ensure their survival and power, often through military means. The distribution of power among states is a key determinant of their behavior, and the security dilemma (actions taken for self-defense can be seen as threats by others) is a pervasive problem. International relations are often seen as a zero-sum game, where one state's gain is another's loss.

## Key Concepts and Principles

1. **Self-centric focus**: Realism emphasizes that states prioritize their own interests above all else. This means that states are primarily concerned with their own survival, security, and prosperity. They act in ways that maximize their own well-being without necessarily considering the interests or well-being of other states, unless it serves their own goals.

2. **Anarchy**: Anarchy in international relations refers to the absence of a central authority or world government that can enforce rules and order among states. Unlike within a nation where there is a central government with authority, in the international system, there is no higher authority that can prevent or regulate conflicts between states. This absence of a central authority contributes to the competitive and potentially conflictual nature of international relations.

3. **Self-help & Survival**: Realism posits that states are in a constant state of self-help, meaning they must take measures to ensure their own survival and security. Given the absence of a global police force, states must rely on their own resources and capabilities to protect themselves. This often leads to the pursuit of military strength and alliances to deter potential threats.

4. **Distributions of power**: Realism places great importance on the distribution of power among states. States are seen as rational actors that assess the power and capabilities of other states to determine their own strategies. Changes in the distribution of power can lead to shifts in international relations as rising powers challenge the established order, potentially leading to conflict.

5. **Security dilemma**: The security dilemma is a key concept in Realism. It refers to the situation where states' efforts to enhance their own security, such as building up military forces or forming alliances, can inadvertently be perceived as threats by other states. This can lead to a cycle of insecurity, arms races, and tension as each state responds defensively to the perceived threats of others.

6. **Zero-sum game**: Realism often portrays international relations as a zero-sum game, where one state's gain is seen as another state's loss. In other words, the pursuit of one state's interests is often at the expense of other states. This view can lead to a competitive and conflict-prone international environment where cooperation is limited.

These principles collectively form the foundation of Realism, emphasizing state-centric behavior, competition, and the struggle for power and security in an anarchic international system. While Realism provides valuable insights into certain aspects of international relations, it is critiqued for its sometimes overly pessimistic view and its tendency to downplay the potential for cooperation and diplomacy among states.


## **Critiques of Realism**

- **Oversimplification**: Critics argue that realism oversimplifies the complexities of international relations by reducing state behavior to a narrow focus on power and self-interest.

- **Neglect of Non-State Actors**: Realism tends to neglect the influence and role of non-state actors, such as international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and multinational corporations, which play significant roles in contemporary global politics.

- **Neglect of Non-Material Factors**: Realism predominantly emphasizes material factors like military power and economic interests, often overlooking non-material factors like ideology, identity, and norms.

- **Perpetual Cycle of Conflict**: Realism's focus on competition and self-interest may contribute to a pessimistic view of international relations, potentially perpetuating conflicts and power struggles.

## **Strengths and Weaknesses of Realism**

- **Strengths**: Realism provides a realistic assessment of power dynamics in international relations, recognizing the inherent competitive nature of states' interactions.

- **Weaknesses**: Realism is criticized for its pessimistic outlook on international relations, as it often downplays the potential for cooperation and diplomatic solutions to conflicts.

## **Limitations of Realism**

- Realism does not adequately account for the role of international institutions, which can serve as mechanisms for conflict resolution and cooperation among states.

- Realism tends to neglect the influence and significance of non-state actors, which have become increasingly important in shaping global politics.

- Realism's narrow focus on power struggles may limit its ability to explain cooperative efforts and diplomacy beyond purely competitive interactions among states.

In summary, while realism provides insights into power politics and state-centric behavior in international relations, it faces critiques for oversimplification, neglect of non-state actors, and a potentially pessimistic outlook. Its limitations include a lack of consideration for international institutions, non-material factors, and the potential for cooperative solutions in global affairs.
