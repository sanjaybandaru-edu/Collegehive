## Distinguishing Citizen Diplomacy from Summit Diplomacy
Citizen diplomacy and summit diplomacy represent two distinct approaches to international relations and engagement. Let's explore the key differences between these two types of diplomacy.

### Citizen Diplomacy
- **Grassroots Engagement**: Citizen diplomacy emphasizes the role of individual citizens or groups in fostering mutual understanding and relationships between countries at a grassroots level.
- **People-to-People Interaction**: It is driven by direct interactions among people, such as cultural exchanges, educational programs, and business collaborations that are not necessarily steered by government policies or involvement.
- **Non-Governmental Efforts**: Citizen diplomacy is often orchestrated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), professional associations, or even informal groups and individuals.
- **Informal Nature**: This type of diplomacy tends to be informal, flexible, and can adapt quickly to the needs and interests of the participants.
- **Broad Objectives**: The goals are often broad, aiming to build long-term relationships, increase cultural understanding, and contribute to peace and cooperation on a global scale.

### Summit Diplomacy
- **High-Level Engagements**: Summit diplomacy involves interactions at the highest political levels, such as heads of state, ministers, or ambassadors.
- **Formal Negotiations**: This diplomacy is formal, often taking place at organized summits or official meetings where significant policy decisions, treaties, or international agreements are discussed.
- **Government-Led Initiatives**: It is driven by national governments and is part of the official diplomatic practice, which follows established protocols and procedures.
- **Strategic and Policy-Focused**: Summit diplomacy is generally focused on strategic goals, policymaking, and resolving complex international issues.
- **Binding Decisions**: The outcomes of summit diplomacy can be binding agreements, which carry legal obligations for the countries involved.

In essence, citizen diplomacy operates from the bottom up, with individuals and communities engaging across borders to create a foundation of goodwill and collaboration, while summit diplomacy works from the top down, with national leaders making decisions that shape international relations and global policy.

Each type of diplomacy serves a distinct role in international relations, addressing various aspects of global cooperation. These forms illustrate how diplomacy is applied across different fields to achieve diplomatic objectives and foster global understanding and peace.
