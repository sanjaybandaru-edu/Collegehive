# International Security: Traditional and Non-Traditional Aspects

International security is a multifaceted concept that involves a range of threats. These threats can be broadly categorized into traditional and non-traditional aspects, each affecting nations, individuals, and humanity differently.

## Traditional Security Threats

- **Military Threats**: Traditional threats primarily encompass military actions that compromise a nation's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and economic stability. 

### Characteristics of Traditional Threats:
- Often arise from other nations.
- Impact the state's ability to protect its borders and maintain sovereignty.
- Include wars, military occupations, and invasions.
- Can disrupt international trade and national economies.

## Non-Traditional Security Threats

Non-traditional threats are diverse and can affect states, individuals, and humanity as a whole. They extend beyond military confrontations and include a variety of challenges.

### Examples of Non-Traditional Threats:

1. **From Natural Occurrences**:
   - Disasters like tsunamis, coastal erosion, floods, and high winds threaten lives and infrastructure, prompting population displacements.

2. **From Non-State Actors**:
   - Activities such as environmental contamination, drug trafficking, illegal fishing, religious extremism, and terrorism pose threats beyond traditional warfare.

3. **From Military Development**:
   - The arms race among nations can inadvertently increase the security dilemma, attracting undesirable attention from potential adversaries.

4. **From Piracy**:
   - Regions like the Red Sea, Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia face piracy, affecting international maritime trade. Notable piracy hotspots include the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

5. **From Maritime Terrorism**:
   - Historical lack of maritime security allowed terrorist organizations to exploit sea routes. An example is the invasion of Malabar via the sea in December 1782.

6. **From Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) Fishing**:
   - IUU fishing within territorial waters affects the livelihood of coastal communities, depletes fish stocks, reduces fishermen's profits, and harms the environment, with the Indian Ocean being particularly affected.

### Impact of Non-Traditional Threats:
- Extend beyond the state to include individuals and humanity as a whole.
- Can result in humanitarian crises and large-scale disruptions.
- Require comprehensive responses involving international cooperation and non-military solutions.

While traditional threats to international security have focused on military confrontations, non-traditional threats encompass a broader spectrum of challenges that require global attention and collaborative solutions. Addressing these threats involves a combination of policy measures, humanitarian aid, and international law enforcement to ensure collective security and the well-being of populations worldwide.

## Difference between Traditional and Non-Traditional Security Threats

| Traditional Security                                    | Non-Traditional Security                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Concerned primarily with military threats.              | Extends beyond military threats.                     |
| Focuses on state-centric values: sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence. | Focuses on human-centric issues: human rights, environmental challenges, and global health. |
| Endangers the lives of citizens through military action. | Impacts human existence through various non-military threats. |
| Threats can be external (from other countries) or internal (secessionist groups or regions within a state). | Threats often arise from non-state actors and are transnational, like terrorism, climate change, etc. |
| Use of force is both a threat and a means to achieve peace and security. | Cooperation among nation-states is key to addressing threats, rather than military action. |
| Strategies include defense, deterrence, forming alliances, and maintaining a balance of power. | Strategies are based on international cooperation, addressing root causes of insecurity, and preventive measures. |
| Traditional threats are more straightforward and can often be anticipated or prepared for. | Non-traditional threats are diverse and can be unpredictable, requiring adaptive and multifaceted responses. |
