## Peacemaking

 Peacemaking is a process that helps resolve conflicts and establish peace. It involves a variety of measures, including diplomatic actions, nonviolent tactics, and justice and forgiveness. Peacemaking is often used interchangeably with peacebuilding, but the two concepts are distinct. While peacemaking focuses on resolving conflicts in progress, peacebuilding aims to transform the conditions that lead to conflict.

Peacemaking involves measures to address and resolve conflicts in progress, which typically encompasses:

- **Diplomatic actions:** Initiatives to bring conflicting parties to a negotiation table.
- **Nonviolent tactics:** Employing nonviolent methods to end conflicts and establish lasting peace.
- **Justice and forgiveness:** Using these principles to interrupt cycles of violence.
- **Equitable power relationships:** Creating balanced power dynamics within communities.
- **Community-based ethical decisions:** Making choices that benefit the whole community.
- **Conflict dialogue:** Discussing issues openly to resolve underlying problems.

Notably, Mahatma Gandhi was a major proponent of nonviolence as a tool for peacemaking.

## Peacebuilding

Peacebuilding is a process that aims to transform the conditions that lead to conflict. It involves a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of conflict and promotes long-term peace. Peacebuilding is often used interchangeably with peacemaking, but the two concepts are distinct. While peacemaking focuses on resolving conflicts in progress, peacebuilding aims to transform the conditions that lead to conflict.

The concept of peacebuilding emerged to transform the conditions leading to conflict. It is a comprehensive approach involving all affected parties and focuses on:

Peacebuilding aims to not only resolve current conflicts but also to prevent future ones by addressing root causes and promoting enduring peace.
