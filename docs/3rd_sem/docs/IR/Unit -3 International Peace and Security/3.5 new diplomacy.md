# New Diplomacy

New diplomacy refers to the modern practice of international relations, which involves a broader array of actors and utilizes innovative approaches and technologies.

## Types of New Diplomacy

The evolution of diplomacy reflects the increasing complexity of international relations in a globalized world. Here's a more detailed explanation of each type of new diplomacy:

1. **Track II Diplomacy**: This form of diplomacy operates outside the official governmental channels. It typically involves individuals or groups who are not officially part of the government but have significant influence or expertise, such as academics, think tanks, private sector leaders, and NGOs. Their role is often to create an informal environment where complex issues can be discussed more openly and creatively than in formal settings. Track II diplomacy fosters mutual understanding and can help to build the groundwork for official negotiations. The Oslo Accords are a prime example, where unofficial discussions laid the foundation for formal peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.

2. **Parliamentary Diplomacy**: This involves members of legislative bodies from different countries engaging in dialogue and exchange. Unlike traditional diplomacy, which is executed by executive branches (like the State Department in the U.S.), parliamentary diplomacy allows legislators to use their unique position to influence foreign policy, promote democratic values, and strengthen international cooperation. Such diplomacy often occurs in international assemblies or organizations, like the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, where legislators discuss issues like security, democracy, and international law.

3. **Science Diplomacy**: This approach uses scientific collaboration to address global challenges and build bridges between nations. Science diplomacy can take various forms, including collaborative research projects, science advice in diplomatic contexts, and scientific cooperation as a tool for improving international relations. A prominent example is the International Space Station (ISS), which represents a significant joint effort among multiple countries for scientific research in space. The ISS demonstrates how science can transcend geopolitical boundaries, fostering cooperation even among nations that may have strained political relationships.

These forms of diplomacy acknowledge the interconnectedness of today's world, where issues and challenges are no longer confined within national borders. They represent a shift from traditional state-centric diplomacy to more inclusive approaches that involve a variety of actors, from NGOs and scientists to lawmakers and private sector experts. This diversification in diplomatic practices is crucial for addressing the multifaceted problems of the 21st century and promoting a more collaborative and peaceful international order.
