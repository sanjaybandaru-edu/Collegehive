# India's Role in regional organizations

## South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)

South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic and geopolitical organization of eight countries that are primarily located in South Asia or the Indian subcontinent. The SAARC Secretariat is based in Kathmandu, Nepal. The combined economy of SAARC is the third largest in the world in the terms of GDP (PPP) after the United States and China and fifth largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP. SAARC nations comprise 3% of the world's area, 21% of the world's population and 4.21% (US$3.67 trillion) of the global economy, as of 2019.

### Failure of SAARC

SAARC has failed to live up to its promise. The reasons for this are:

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has encountered numerous obstacles that have hindered its progress and effectiveness. Among these challenges are:

1. **India-Pakistan Rivalry**: This longstanding conflict often overshadows regional cooperation within SAARC. For instance, the cancellation of the 19th SAARC Summit in 2016 due to India's withdrawal in response to the Uri terrorist attack highlights how bilateral tensions can disrupt SAARC's activities.

2. **Bilateral Disputes**: Disputes between other member countries, like the Indo-Nepal border disputes and historical tensions between Sri Lanka and India, have negatively impacted the cooperative environment within SAARC.

3. **Lack of Trust and Confidence**: Historical mistrust and unresolved conflicts among member states, such as between India and Nepal, have limited cooperation and led to diplomatic tensions.

4. **Non-Cooperation by Member States**: Some members have been reluctant to fully engage in SAARC initiatives. Bhutan's hesitance to join certain activities due to its concerns about China is an example of this.

5. **Security Concerns**: Issues like terrorism and insurgency, notably the cross-border terrorism between India and Pakistan, have strained relations and impeded collective efforts to address these challenges within the region.

6. **Asymmetry in Economic Power**: The economic dominance of India in SAARC has raised concerns among smaller member states about potential overshadowing and imbalanced benefits, affecting their enthusiasm for regional economic cooperation.

7. **Lack of Progress in Key Agreements**: Agreements like the SAARC Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) have not been fully realized, partly due to non-tariff barriers and a lack of trust among member states.

8. **Geostrategic Competition**: The involvement of external powers such as China and the United States has introduced additional complexity and potential rivalry, affecting the regional dynamics.

These issues collectively contribute to SAARC's limited success in achieving its goals of regional cooperation and peace-building. The organization faces a challenging road ahead in addressing these diverse and deep-rooted problems.

## BRICS

BRICS, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, indeed plays a significant role in helping India balance its strategic interests with major global powers like the United States, Russia, and China. This is achieved through various means:

1. **Multipolarity and Diversification**: BRICS epitomizes a multipolar world order, giving India a platform to diversify its international relations. Amid escalating tensions between the United States and China, India has been able to maintain a balanced approach, engaging with both powers within the BRICS framework. This diversification is crucial in a rapidly changing global political landscape.

2. **Economic Cooperation**: As major economic players, BRICS countries foster trade and investment opportunities. India benefits from these economic ties, including trade agreements and initiatives like the New Development Bank (NDB). This cooperation allows India to pursue economic growth without heavy reliance on any one country, balancing its economic engagements with major powers.

3. **Geopolitical Consultation**: BRICS serves as a forum for dialogue on global issues, enabling India to voice its concerns and influence collective responses. India has leveraged BRICS summits to address issues like terrorism, climate change, and global governance, showing its capability to engage in a multilateral setting.

4. **Strategic Autonomy**: Participation in BRICS allows India to assert its strategic autonomy, avoiding over-reliance on any single power. This is particularly important for India, given its size and global significance. It provides a counterbalance to its growing defense and strategic ties with the United States.

5. **Security and Defense Cooperation**: BRICS enables member states to engage in security and defense dialogues. For India, this means maintaining a balanced approach in its relationships with both Russia and China. Joint military exercises conducted under the BRICS umbrella allow for military collaboration while preserving strategic independence.

6. **Soft Power and Cultural Diplomacy**: BRICS also presents an opportunity for India to promote its soft power and cultural heritage. Through cultural and educational exchanges and hosting BRICS summits, India can enhance its global profile and influence, contributing positively to its international image.

7. **Crisis Management and Conflict Resolution**: As a platform for discussing global crises and conflicts, BRICS is crucial for India, situated in a region with several conflict-prone areas. The grouping's involvement in issues like the Syrian conflict highlights its potential as a forum for conflict management and resolution.

In summary, BRICS provides a valuable platform for India to engage with major global powers while maintaining strategic autonomy. It allows India to participate in a multipolar world, balancing its interests across economic, political, and security domains and promoting its national interests on the global stage.
