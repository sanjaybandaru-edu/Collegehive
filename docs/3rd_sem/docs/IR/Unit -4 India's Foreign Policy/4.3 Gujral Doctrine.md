# Gujral Doctrine

## What is Gujral doctrine?
The Gujral Doctrine is a set of five guiding principles for dealing with India’s close neighbors. These five guiding principles are the result of the conviction that India’s stature and power are inextricably linked to the nature of its ties with its neighbors. Thus, it acknowledges the paramount significance of amicable, cordial relationships between neighbors.

### These ideas include:

- India doesn’t demand anything in return from its neighbors, such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, but instead provides what it can in a spirit of confidence and good faith.
- No South Asian nation should permit the use of its territory to harm the interests of another nation in the region.
- No nation should meddle in another’s domestic affairs.
- Each South Asian nation is required to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the other.
- All of their differences should be resolved through cordial bilateral dialogue.
