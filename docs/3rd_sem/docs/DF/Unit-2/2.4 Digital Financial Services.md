Credit cards allow users to borrow money up to a predefined credit limit and pay it back with interest, while debit cards deduct funds directly from the user's bank account. Prepaid cards are loaded with a specific amount of money in advance.

 ATMs are self-service machines that allow individuals to perform basic banking transactions without visiting a physical bank branch. Users can withdraw cash, check account balances, deposit funds, and transfer money between accounts. ATMs are usually available 24/7 at various locations, providing convenient access to banking services.

 Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system and a digital payment platform developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It facilitates interbank transactions by instantly transferring funds between bank accounts using mobile phones or computers. UPI has gained popularity for its ease of use and seamless fund transfers.

Users can make payments and online purchases through e-wallets without sharing their sensitive financial data. Popular examples include PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay.

- POS Terminals (Point of Sale Terminals)

 POS terminals are devices used by businesses and retailers to accept payments from customers. These terminals are commonly found at checkout counters in physical stores.
