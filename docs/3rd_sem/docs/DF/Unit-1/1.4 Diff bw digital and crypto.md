| **Issuer**           | Typically issued by a central authority (e.g., government, central bank) and often tied to a national currency. | Created through a process called mining or issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs) by individuals or organizations. |
| **Regulation**       | Subject to government regulations and monetary policies. Transactions can be monitored and controlled by authorities. | Largely unregulated or subject to varying degrees of regulation depending on the country. Transactions are pseudonymous and can be more private. |
| **Transaction Speed**| Generally offers faster transaction speeds and scalability for everyday transactions. | Transaction speeds can vary significantly based on the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, sometimes leading to longer confirmation times. |
