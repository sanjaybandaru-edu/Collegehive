- Opportunity: This element of the triangle suggests that individuals commit fraud because they can; they have the means to execute the plan without being detected.
- Pressure (Risk Treatment): Here, individuals feel a financial or emotional force that compels them toward fraudulent behavior, often due to financial stress or unattainable performance targets.
- Rationalization: This is the mental process where individuals justify their fraudulent actions to themselves, often by downplaying the seriousness or shifting the blame to justify their dishonest actions.
