3. **Integration**: Digital financial supply chains are often integrated with other business systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, which allows for seamless data flow and better coordination between the financial and physical supply chains.

4. **Instant Payments**: Digital financial supply chains enable instant payments, which can improve cash flow and reduce the risk of late payments.

This digital upgrade can lead to cost savings, better cash flow management, and can give a company a competitive edge in the market.
