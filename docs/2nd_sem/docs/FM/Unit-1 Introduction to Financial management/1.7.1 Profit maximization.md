## Drawbacks of Profit Maximization

Profit maximization objectives have certain drawbacks:

(i) **Vagueness**: Profit maximization does not define profit precisely, leading to differing opinions about a business's earnings.

(ii) **Ignoring Time Value of Money**: It doesn't consider the time value of money or the net present value of cash inflows, leading to discrepancies between actual and net present cash flows.

(iii) **Ignoring Risk**: Profit maximization ignores the risk associated with business operations, both internal and external, which can significantly impact the business's overall performance.

While profit maximization is a common objective, businesses must carefully balance this goal with ethical considerations, societal impacts, and the long-term sustainability of their operations.
