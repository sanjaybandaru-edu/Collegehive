# Internal Relations of Financial Decisions

Financial decisions are interconnected within an organization, and understanding their internal relations is essential for effective financial management. These decisions, including investment decisions, financing decisions, and dividend decisions, impact each other and contribute to the overall financial health and success of the organization. In this document, we will explore the concept of internal relations of financial decisions, their significance, key principles, and provide relevant examples. The content is designed for seasoned professionals in financial management, demonstrating advanced knowledge and principles of corporate finance, investments, financial markets, and related domains.

## 1. Interplay of Financial Decisions

Financial decisions within an organization are interrelated and have implications for one another. The three main types of financial decisions - investment decisions, financing decisions, and dividend decisions - interact internally. Understanding their interplay helps optimize resource allocation, manage risk, and enhance the organization's financial position.

## 2. Investment and Financing Decisions

Investment decisions and financing decisions have a close relationship. The availability and cost of financing impact investment decisions, while investment decisions influence the financing needs of the organization.

### 2.1 Investment Decisions and Financing Needs
Investment decisions determine the allocation of financial resources to different projects or assets. The capital required for investments affects the organization's financing needs. When evaluating investment opportunities, organizations consider the availability of internal funds, external financing options, and the cost of capital. Financing decisions are influenced by the investment decisions made, as organizations seek appropriate sources of financing to fund their investments.

### 2.2 Financing Decisions and Investment Opportunities
Financing decisions determine the optimal mix of debt and equity financing for the organization. The financing structure affects the organization's cost of capital and financial risk. The availability and cost of financing impact the feasibility and attractiveness of investment opportunities. Investment decisions consider the organization's financing capacity, cost of capital, and debt service obligations.

## 3. Investment and Dividend Decisions

Investment decisions and dividend decisions are connected as they involve the allocation of profits and the consideration of future cash flows.

### 3.1 Investment Opportunities and Retained Earnings
Investment decisions influence the allocation of profits between dividend distributions and retained earnings. Organizations may retain earnings to fund future investments, expansion, or research and development activities. By retaining earnings, organizations can enhance their financial capacity and generate internal funds for future investment opportunities.

### 3.2 Dividend Decisions and Cash Availability
Dividend decisions consider the organization's profitability, cash flow position, and the expectations of shareholders. Dividend distributions impact the availability of cash for investments. Higher dividend payouts reduce the funds available for investment purposes. Organizations need to strike a balance between dividend distributions and retaining earnings for future investment opportunities.

## 4. Example of Internal Relations of Financial Decisions

An example can help illustrate the internal relations of financial decisions:

A manufacturing company is evaluating a potential investment project that requires an initial investment of $1 million. The project is expected to generate annual cash flows of $300,000 for five years. The organization's cost of capital is 10%.

To evaluate the project, the company calculates the Net Present Value (NPV) using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. Assuming a discount rate of 10%, the NPV is calculated as follows:

NPV = Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^n

NPV = ($300,000 / (1 + 0.10)^1) + ($300,000 / (1 + 0.10)^2) + ($300,000 / (1 + 0.10)^3) + ($300,000 / (1 + 0.10)^4) + ($300,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5) - $1,000,000

NPV = $241,573.44

The positive NPV indicates that the project is financially attractive and contributes to the organization's overall value. However, the organization needs to assess its financing capacity to determine the optimal financing mix. If the company decides to finance the project partially with debt, it needs to evaluate the impact on its debt service obligations and financial risk.

Additionally, the decision on dividend distributions can affect the availability of cash for the investment. If the company decides to distribute a significant portion of profits as dividends, it may need to explore external financing options to fund the investment project adequately.

Understanding the internal relations of financial decisions is crucial for effective financial management. Investment decisions and financing decisions are interconnected, influencing each other's feasibility and attractiveness. Investment decisions also affect dividend decisions, as they impact the allocation of profits between dividend distributions and retained earnings. By considering these internal relations, seasoned professionals in financial management can optimize resource allocation, manage risk, and enhance the overall financial position of the organization.
