# Capital Gearing

**Capital gearing**, often referred to as the **gearing ratio**, is a financial metric that evaluates the proportion of debt a company has relative to its equity. In the United States, this concept is commonly known as "leverage."

The gearing ratio measures the financial risk of a company and expresses the amount of a company's debt in terms of its equity. A higher gearing ratio indicates that a company has a larger amount of debt relative to its equity value. For example, a company with a gearing ratio of 2.0 would have twice as much debt as equity.

The formula for calculating the capital gearing ratio is as follows:

**Capital Gearing Ratio** = Common Stockholders' Equity / Fixed Cost Bearing Funds

In this formula:
- **Common Stockholders' Equity** includes share capital, share premium, general reserves, and participatory preference shares. It represents the equity portion of the company's capital structure.
- **Fixed Cost Bearing Funds** consist of long-term bonds, term loans, and preference shares with fixed dividend payouts. These represent the debt portion of the capital structure.

**Importance of Capital Gearing Ratio:**

The gearing ratio is a crucial metric for assessing a company's financial health and risk. It helps investors and analysts understand how a company uses debt to enhance its capital. Here are some key points regarding the importance of the gearing ratio:

1. **Financial Risk Assessment:** The gearing ratio provides insights into the financial risk or solvency risk of a company. It measures the impact of debt on the capital structure and evaluates the level of financial risk associated with additional debt.

2. **Capital Efficiency:** It assesses how efficiently a company utilizes its capital structure by balancing debt and equity. Debt can offer cost advantages due to tax shields on interest payments, but it also creates committed liabilities.

3. **Investor Decision-Making:** Investors use the gearing ratio to make informed investment decisions. A high gearing ratio may indicate higher financial risk, while a low ratio suggests a more conservative capital structure.

4. **Creditworthiness:** Lenders and creditors assess a company's gearing ratio to evaluate its creditworthiness. A lower gearing ratio may lead to more favorable borrowing terms.

5. **Capital Structure Optimization:** Companies can use the gearing ratio to optimize their capital structure. By adjusting the mix of debt and equity, they can lower their cost of capital and enhance shareholder value.

In summary, the capital gearing ratio is a valuable tool for understanding how a company leverages debt in its capital structure. It aids in evaluating financial risk, optimizing capital, and making informed investment and credit decisions.
