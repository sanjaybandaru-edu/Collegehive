# Ploughing Back of Profits

The *Ploughing Back of Profits* is a financial management strategy in which a company retains a portion of its earnings instead of distributing them entirely as dividends to shareholders. This retained profit is then reinvested in the company for its further development and growth. This practice is also referred to as *Self-Financing*, *Internal Financing*, or *Inter-Financing*.

## **Factors Affecting Ploughing Back of Profits**

Several factors influence a company's decision to plough back profits:

a. **Earning Capacity:** The ability to plough back profits largely depends on the earning capacity of the company. Companies with higher earning capacities are more likely to retain and reinvest profits.

b. **Shareholders' Preferences:** The desire and type of shareholders play a role in this decision. Shareholders' preferences vary; some may prefer maximum profit distribution as dividends, while others, especially wealthier investors, may be more inclined to support profit retention for future growth.

c. **Future Financial Requirements:** The company's anticipated future financial needs impact its ploughing-back strategy. If there are attractive investment opportunities for future development, the company is more likely to reinvest profits.

d. **Dividend Policy:** The company's dividend policy is a critical factor. To effectively plough back profits, a company cannot have an excessively high dividend payout policy.

e. **Taxation Policy:** Government taxation policies also influence profit reinvestment. The taxation rate imposed on businesses affects a company's net earnings and, consequently, its ability to reinvest profits.

Ploughing back profits is a prudent financial management approach that allows companies to utilize their earnings to fund future expansion and development, thereby enhancing their long-term sustainability and growth prospects.
