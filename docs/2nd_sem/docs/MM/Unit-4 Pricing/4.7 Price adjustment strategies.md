## 1. **Discount and Allowance Pricing**
Discount and allowance pricing aims to increase sales or accelerate payments by offering reduced prices to customers. Discounts can be offered based on the timing of payment, the quantity of purchase, or as allowances in return for some promotional activity.

- **Example:** A wholesaler might offer a volume discount where customers receive a 10% discount when they purchase 1,000 units or more. Similarly, an early payment discount might be offered to encourage quick payment, like a 2% discount if the invoice is paid within 10 days.

## 2. **Segmented Pricing**
Segmented pricing acknowledges that different customers may be willing to pay different prices for the same product or service. This strategy involves setting different prices for different segments without a proportional difference in production costs.

- **Example:** An amusement park may charge lower entrance fees for children and senior citizens compared to adults. Although the cost of operations remains the same, this pricing acknowledges the different price sensitivities among various age groups.

## 3. **Psychological Pricing**
Psychological pricing leverages the psychological impact of price points on consumer perception and purchase behavior. It's often used to signal quality, create a sense of urgency, or improve the perceived value.

- **Example:** Pricing a product at INR 999 instead of INR 1,000 creates a perception of a bargain due to the psychological impact of the left digit changing, making the price seem lower than it actually is.

## 4. **Promotional Pricing**
Promotional pricing aims to boost sales over a short period through special promotions. This could mean temporarily pricing products below the list price or even below cost.

- **Example:** During a festive sale, an electronics retailer might offer a discount of INR 2,000 on a laptop to attract more customers and clear out inventory.

## 5. **Geographical Pricing**
Geographical pricing takes into account the geographical location of customers, adjusting prices based on regional factors such as transportation costs, local market conditions, and regional taxes or tariffs.

- **Example:** A furniture store might charge additional delivery fees for customers located further away to cover the higher transportation costs.

## 6. **Dynamic Pricing**
Dynamic pricing is a more flexible pricing strategy where prices are adjusted continually based on various factors such as real-time demand, competitor prices, and other market dynamics.

- **Example:** E-commerce platforms like Amazon employ dynamic pricing algorithms to continually adjust prices based on supply and demand, competitor prices, and other external factors, ensuring competitiveness and profitability.

## 7. **International Pricing**
International pricing requires a careful consideration of various factors when setting prices for products sold internationally. Factors include exchange rates, local market conditions, laws and regulations, and competitive landscape.

- **Example:** A global brand like Apple might price its products differently in the US compared to India due to factors such as import taxes, shipping costs, and the economic conditions of each country.

These price adjustment strategies are tailored to suit different market needs and customer segments, helping businesses to optimize their pricing structures, align pricing strategies with market conditions, and achieve their financial and strategic objectives. Each strategy serves to attract certain consumer demographics, meet specific marketing objectives, and navigate the competitive landscape effectively. Through adept application of these strategies, companies can enhance their market position, profitability, and customer satisfaction.
