# Wholesaling, Retailing, and Physical Distribution

The success of a product in the market significantly depends on how efficiently it is distributed. This involves various intermediaries and processes such as wholesaling, retailing, and physical distribution. Here's a breakdown of these terms with a structured explanation:

## 1. Wholesaling

Wholesaling involves selling goods in large quantities to be retailed by others. Wholesalers act as intermediaries between manufacturers and retailers, providing a crucial link in the distribution chain.

- **Transportation**: Wholesalers may provide transportation services to deliver goods to retailers.
- **Financing**: They often provide credit to retailers, facilitating smoother financial operations.
- **Market Information**: Wholesalers can provide market insights to both manufacturers and retailers, aiding in better decision-making.

## 2. Retailing

Retailing involves selling goods in small quantities to the end consumer. Retailers are the final link in the distribution chain, making products available for consumer purchase.
