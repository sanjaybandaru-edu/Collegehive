# Direct Marketing
Direct Marketing is a promotional method that involves presenting information about your company, product, or service to your target customer without the use of an advertising middleman. It's a targeted form of marketing that presents information of potential interest to a consumer that has been determined to be a likely buyer.

## Direct Marketing Channels
Face-to-face selling by a sales force: This method entails a sales team personally engaging with potential customers to sell products or services. This method is highly personal and allows for immediate feedback and communication.

1. Face-to-face selling at company's showrooms or retail outlets: Similar to the first method, this occurs in a retail setting where customers can interact with sales representatives in person, view products, and make purchases.

2. Direct Mail Marketing: This involves sending physical promotional materials via postal mail directly to prospective customers. Direct mail pieces may include catalogs, flyers, or special offers.

3. Fax or E-mail Marketing: Companies can send order forms, catalogs, or promotional offers via fax or email. This method is less common today due to the rise of digital marketing channels.

4. Online Marketing/Cyber Marketing: This encompasses a wide range of marketing techniques and platforms, including social media marketing, email marketing, and search engine marketing. It involves using websites, email, and social platforms to promote a product or service.

5. Mobile Marketing (M-mail, SMS/MMS): This channel uses mobile devices to deliver marketing messages. This can include text messages (SMS), multimedia messages (MMS), app advertisements, and more.

6. Kiosk Marketing: Interactive kiosks are standalone machines that provide information and services. Customers can place orders or gather information using electronic kiosks.

7. Automatic Vending Machine: These machines sell products without human intervention. Common products sold via vending machines include beverages, snacks, and tickets.

8. Telemarketing and Voice Mail: Telemarketing involves contacting potential customers over the phone to sell products or services. Voice mail marketing occurs when a prerecorded marketing message is left on a potential customerâ€™s voice mail.

These methods can be utilized individually or integrated to create a multi-channel direct marketing strategy. Each has its own set of advantages, challenges, and is suited to different types of businesses and products. The choice of channel often depends on the target audience, the nature of the product, and the available budget.
