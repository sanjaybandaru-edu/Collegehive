# Trend Analysis

Trend analysis is a technique used to analyze financial data over a period to identify patterns and growth trends. It helps understand how a company's performance has changed over time.

## 1. Setting a Base Year

Trend analysis involves selecting a **base year** and setting its values to 100. Subsequent years' values are then expressed as a percentage of the base year's values. This allows for easy comparison of growth rates over time.

## 2. Trend Analysis of the Balance Sheet

**Example (Capital Side):**

Assume a base year of 2011. A simplified trend analysis of the capital side of a balance sheet might look like this:

| Item              | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | ... | 2021 |
| :---------------- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :-: | :--- |
| Share Capital     | 100  | 100  | 100  | ... | 100  |
| Reserves/Other Equity | 100  | 150  | 200  | ... | 500  |
| Borrowings        | 100  | 90   | 80   | ... | 50   |
| Trade Payables    | 100  | 120  | 150  | ... | 250  |
| Other Liabilities | 100  | 110  | 130  | ... | 200  |

**Analysis:**

*   Share capital remained constant, indicating no new equity issuance.
*   Reserves/other equity increased significantly (five times), showing strong retained earnings.
*   Borrowings decreased, suggesting reduced reliance on debt financing.
*   Trade payables and other liabilities increased, likely due to business expansion and increased procurement of raw materials.

**Example (Asset Side):**

| Item                | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | ... | 2021 |
| :------------------ | :--- | :--- | :--- | :-: | :--- |
| Fixed Assets        | 100  | 120  | 150  | ... | 469  |
| Inventory           | 100  | 110  | 130  | ... | 220  |
| Trade Receivables   | 100  | 115  | 140  | ... | 210  |
| Cash and Bank Balance | 100  | 95   | 85   | ... | 70   |

**Analysis:**

*   All asset values increased except cash and bank balance, indicating reinvestment in the business.
*   The increase in fixed assets suggests capacity expansion.
*   The increase in inventory and trade receivables is consistent with increased sales and credit sales.

## 3. Trend Analysis of the Profit and Loss (Income) Statement

**Example:**

| Item              | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | ... | 2021 |
| :---------------- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :-: | :--- |
| Sales             | 100  | 130  | 160  | ... | 284  |
| Profit After Tax (PAT) | 100  | 140  | 180  | ... | 342  |

**Analysis:**

*   Sales increased by 2.84 times.
*   PAT increased by 3.42 times, indicating improved profitability.
