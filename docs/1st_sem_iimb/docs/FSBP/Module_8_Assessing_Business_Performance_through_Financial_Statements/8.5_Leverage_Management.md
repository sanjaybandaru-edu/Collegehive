# Leverage Management

## Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

* ROCE measures the return generated on the capital employed in the business. 
* **Formula:** ROCE = Profit before interest and tax/Capital employed.
* Capital employed is defined as total assets less payables. This adjustment accounts for the fact that suppliers provide a form of financing through credit terms.
* Using previous table as used in previous topics

| Metric                     | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------|
| Total Assets                | 150    | 300    |
| Payables                    | 10     | 20     |
| Capital Employed (Assets - Payables) | 140    | 280    |
| Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT) | 16     | 149    |
| ROCE (PBIT / Capital Employed) | 11.43% | 53.21% |
| Return on Total Assets (ROTA) (PBIT/Total Assets) | 10.67% | 49.67% |
| ROCE - ROTA                 | 0.76%  | 3.55%  |

**Key Observations:**

*   ROCE is higher than ROTA due to the impact of supplier credit (payables). The difference between ROCE and ROTA represents the contribution of payables to profitability.
*   The contribution of payables increased significantly from 0.76% in Year 1 to 3.55% in Year 2, indicating more effective use of supplier credit.

## Impact of Debt

To assess the contribution of debt, we analyze the interest rate (cost of debt) and the debt-to-equity ratio.
* Interest Rate = Interest expense / Loan value
* Debt-to-equity Ratio = Loan Value / Ewuity Value
  
| Metric                     | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------|
| Interest Expense            | 5      | 20     |
| Loan Value                  | 40     | 180    |
| Interest Rate (Interest Expense / Loan Value) | 12.5%  | 11.11% |
| Equity Value                | 100    | 100    |
| Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Loan Value / Equity Value) | 0.4    | 1.8    |
| Spread (ROCE - Interest Rate) | -1.07% | 42.1%  |
| Debt Impact (Spread \* Debt-to-Equity Ratio) | -0.43% | 75.79% |

**Key Observations:**

*   The interest rate decreased slightly from Year 1 to Year 2.
*   The debt-to-equity ratio increased significantly, indicating greater reliance on debt financing in Year 2.
*   In Year 1, the spread was negative (-1.07%), meaning the return generated on capital employed was lower than the cost of debt. This resulted in a negative impact of debt (-0.43%).
*   In Year 2, the spread was highly positive (42.1%), leading to a substantial positive impact of debt (75.79%).

## Return on Equity (ROE)

We analyze both pre-tax and post-tax ROE.

| Metric                       | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Profit Before Tax (PBT)       | 11     | 129    |
| Pre-tax ROE (PBT / Equity)    | 11%    | 129%   |
| Profit After Tax (PAT)        | 9      | 104    |
| Post-tax ROE (PAT / Equity)   | 9%     | 104%   |

**Relationship between ROCE and ROE:**

Pre-tax ROE can be decomposed as follows:

Pre-tax ROE = ROCE + Contribution of Debt

*   Year 1: 11% = 11.43% + (-0.43%)
*   Year 2: 129% = 53.21% + 75.79%

**Key Observations:**

*   The significant increase in pre-tax ROE from 11% to 129% is largely attributable to the positive impact of debt in Year 2. Without debt, the pre-tax ROE in Year 2 would have been equal to the ROCE of 53.21%.
*   The debt contributed 75.79% to the pre-tax ROE in Year 2, demonstrating the powerful effect of leverage when the spread is positive.

## Leverage Effect

The contribution of debt to ROE is known as the leverage effect. It is positive when the spread (ROCE - Interest Rate) is positive and magnified by the debt-to-equity ratio.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Using debt can significantly enhance returns for equity shareholders if the return generated on the borrowed funds exceeds the cost of borrowing.
*   However, if the spread is negative, debt can negatively impact returns.
*   It is crucial to have strong fundamental profitability (high ROCE) before taking on significant debt. In Year 1, the negative spread and low debt-to-equity ratio limited the negative impact. However, in Year 2, the strong ROCE and higher debt-to-equity ratio resulted in a substantial positive impact.

## Post-Tax ROE

Post-tax ROE considers the impact of taxes on profitability. The increase from 9% to 104% reflects the overall improvement in the company's financial performance.
