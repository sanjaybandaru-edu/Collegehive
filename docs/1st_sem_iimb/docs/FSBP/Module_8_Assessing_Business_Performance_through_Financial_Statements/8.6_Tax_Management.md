# Tax Management and its Impact on Profitability
## Tax Rate Analysis

The standard corporate tax rate is assumed to be 30% for simplicity. However, the effective tax rate (actual tax paid as a percentage of pre-tax profit) can vary due to various factors, including tax planning strategies and applicable tax laws.

| Metric                     | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------|
| Profit Before Tax (PBT)       | 11     | 129    |
| Tax Paid                    | 2      | 25     |
| Profit After Tax (PAT)        | 9      | 104    |
| Effective Tax Rate (Tax Paid / PBT) | 18.18% | 19.38% |
| Tax Savings (30% - Effective Tax Rate) | 11.82% | 10.62% |

**Calculations:**

*   **Year 1 Effective Tax Rate:** (2 / 11) \* 100 = 18.18%
*   **Year 1 Tax Savings:** 30% - 18.18% = 11.82%
*   **Year 2 Effective Tax Rate:** (25 / 129) \* 100 = 19.38%
*   **Year 2 Tax Savings:** 30% - 19.38% = 10.62%

**Key Observations:**

*   The effective tax rate was significantly lower than the standard 30% in both years, indicating successful tax management.
*   In Year 1, the effective tax rate was 18.18%, resulting in tax savings of 11.82% compared to the standard rate.
*   In Year 2, the effective tax rate increased slightly to 19.38%, leading to slightly lower tax savings of 10.62%.

## Impact of Tax Savings

Although the percentage of tax savings was slightly lower in Year 2 compared to Year 1, it's crucial to consider the absolute value of the savings and the context of the larger pre-tax profit in Year 2.

*   **Absolute Tax Savings:** While we have only the percentage savings, we can infer that since the pre-tax profit was substantially higher in Year 2 (129 vs. 11), the *absolute amount* of tax saved would also likely be much greater in Year 2.

**Example (Illustrative - Assuming the same pre-tax profit for both years):**

If the pre-tax profit was 100 in both years:

*   Year 1 Tax Savings: 11.82% of 100 = 11.82
*   Year 2 Tax Savings: 10.62% of 100 = 10.62

In this hypothetical scenario, the absolute savings would be slightly lower in Year 2. However, with the actual pre-tax profit of 129 in Year 2, the actual tax saved would be substantially higher.
