# Admission of a New Partner and Goodwill Valuation

## Scenario (Continuing from Previous Example)

*   Ram and Krishna decide to admit Rahul as a new partner.
*   Rahul contributes ₹50 Lakhs as capital.
*   The partners agree to revalue the business using a goodwill valuation method.
*   First-year profit: ₹50 Lakhs.
*   Goodwill multiplier: 3.

## Goodwill Valuation

*   **Goodwill Calculation:** First-year profit (₹50 Lakhs) * Multiplier (3) = ₹150 Lakhs.
*   **Distribution of Goodwill:**
    *   Ram (40%): ₹150 Lakhs * 40% = ₹60 Lakhs
    *   Krishna (60%): ₹150 Lakhs * 60% = ₹90 Lakhs

## Calculating New Capital Balances

To determine the new profit-sharing ratio, we need to calculate the updated capital balances for each partner:

## New Profit-Sharing Ratio

The new profit-sharing ratio is based on the updated capital balances:

*   Ram: ₹100.32/300.8*100=33.35%
*   Krishna: ₹150.48/300.8*100=50.03%
*   Rahul: ₹50/300.8*100=16.62%


## Future Profit Distribution

The profit or loss of the second year (and subsequent years) will be shared among them in the above ratio.
