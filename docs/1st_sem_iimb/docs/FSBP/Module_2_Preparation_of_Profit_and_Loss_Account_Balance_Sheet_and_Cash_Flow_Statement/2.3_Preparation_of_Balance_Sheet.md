# Preparation of the Balance Sheet

The balance sheet, also known as the statement of financial position, provides a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and equity on a particular date. It shows the sources of capital and how that capital has been used to acquire assets.

## 1. Structure

*   **Two Sides:**
    *   **Sources of Capital (Liabilities and Equity):** This side shows how the company has financed its operations. It includes:
        *   Equity Share Capital: Funds invested by shareholders.
        *   Retained Earnings (Profit Retained): Accumulated profits not distributed as dividends.
        *   Loans: Borrowed funds.
        *   Other Liabilities: Obligations to creditors, suppliers, etc.
    *   **Application of Capital (Assets):** This side shows how the company has used its capital to acquire resources. It includes:
        *   **Non-Current Assets (formerly Fixed Assets):** Long-term assets used in operations. Examples:
            *   Tangible Assets: Land, buildings, machinery, computers, furniture.
            *   Intangible Assets: Software, patents, trademarks.
        *   **Current Assets:** Assets expected to be converted to cash or used within one year. Examples:
            *   Cash and cash equivalents.
            *   Accounts receivable.
            *   Inventory.

## 2. Incorporating Adjustment Entries
The balance sheet is prepared *after* all adjustment entries have been made. These entries are crucial for accurate reporting of asset and liability balances. Key adjustment entries affecting the balance sheet include:

*   **Depreciation:** Reduces the carrying value of non-current assets and creates an accumulated depreciation balance (a contra-asset account).
*   **Provision for Doubtful Debts (Allowance for Bad Debts):** Reduces the net realizable value of accounts receivable.
*   **Accrued Expenses:** Creates a liability for expenses incurred but not yet paid.
*   **Prepaid Expenses:** Reduces the asset balance for expenses paid in advance but not yet consumed.
*   **Unearned Revenue:** Creates a liability for revenue received in advance but not yet earned.
*   **Foreign currency adjustments:** Adjusts the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency.
*   **Fair Value adjustments:** Adjusts the value of financial assets to their fair market value.

## 3. The Accounting Equation and Balance Sheet Equilibrium

The balance sheet is based on the fundamental accounting equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

This equation *must* always balance. The total value of assets must equal the total value of liabilities plus equity. If the two sides do not balance, there is an error in the accounting records.

**Key Takeaway:** The balance sheet is a crucial financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company's financial health at a specific point in time. It shows what the company owns (assets) and what it owes (liabilities), as well as the owners' stake in the company (equity). The balance sheet must always balance according to the accounting equation.
