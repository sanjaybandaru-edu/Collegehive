# Module 5: Inventory Accounting and Valuation

## Review from Previous Module (Revenue Recognition)

The previous module covered revenue recognition, the first line item on the income statement. This module builds upon that by exploring the costs associated with generating that revenue.

## Inventory Components

Inventory is a current asset and consists of three main categories:

*   **Raw Materials:** Materials purchased for use in production. Examples include steel for a car manufacturer or fabric for a clothing company.
*   **Work in Progress (WIP):** Goods that are currently in the production process but not yet completed.
*   **Finished Goods:** Completed goods ready for sale.
## Gross Profit

Gross profit is calculated by deducting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from Revenue:

Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = Gross Profit

Gross profit represents the profit a company makes after deducting the direct costs of producing its goods or services. It is a crucial indicator of a company's profitability and efficiency in managing its production costs.
