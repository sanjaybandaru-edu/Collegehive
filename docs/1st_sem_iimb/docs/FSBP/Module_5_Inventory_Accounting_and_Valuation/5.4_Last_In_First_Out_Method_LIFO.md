## The LIFO Method

LIFO assumes that the *most recently purchased* inventory items are sold or used *first*. This is a crucial distinction from FIFO. While LIFO might reflect the actual physical flow in some specific situations (e.g., a pile of coal where the top layer is used first), it is primarily an accounting assumption.

### Example: Perpetual Inventory with LIFO

Using the same purchase data as the FIFO example:

*   Jan 1: 500 units @ ₹200 and 400 has to be issued.
*   Feb 1: 600 units @ ₹230 and 500  has to be issued.
*   Mar 1: 800 units @ ₹210 and 900  has to be issued.
*   Apr 1: 1000 units @ ₹180 and 800 has to be issued.
*   May 1: 700 units @ ₹220 and 500 has to be issued.
*   Jun 1: 400 units @ ₹250 and 600 has to be issued.

Here's the perpetual inventory calculation using LIFO:

| Date    | Transaction | Units | Rate (₹) | Value (₹) | Balance Units | Balance Rate (₹) | Balance Value (₹) |
| :------ | :---------- | :---- | :------- | :-------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :---------------- |
| Jan 1   | Purchase    | 500   | 200     | 100,000   | 500           | 200             | 100,000           |
| Jan 15  | Issue       | 400   | 200     | 80,000    | 100           | 200             | 20,000            |
| Feb 1   | Purchase    | 600   | 230     | 138,000   | 100 @ 200<br>600 @ 230 | 200<br>230          | 20,000<br>138,000 = 158,000            |
| Feb 15  | Issue       | 500   | 230     | 115,000    | 100 @ 200<br>100 @ 230 | 200<br>230           | 20,000<br>23,000= 43,000            |
| Mar 1   | Purchase    | 800   | 210     | 168,000   | 100 @ 200<br>100 @ 230<br>800 @ 210 | 200<br>230<br>210          | 20,000<br>23,000<br>168,000=211,000            |
| Mar 15  | Issue       | 900   | 800 @ 210<br>100 @ 230 | 191,000    | 100           | 200             | 20,000            |
| Apr 1   | Purchase    | 1000  | 180     | 180,000   | 100 @ 200<br>1000 @ 180 | 200<br>180          | 20,000<br>180,000=200,000            |
| Apr 15  | Issue       | 800   | 180     | 144,000    | 100 @ 200<br>200 @ 180 | 200<br>180           | 20,000<br>36,000=56,000            |
| May 1   | Purchase    | 700   | 220     | 154,000   | 100 @ 200<br>200 @ 180<br>700 @ 220 | 200<br>180<br>220          | 20,000<br>36,000<br>154,000=210,000            |
| May 15  | Issue       | 500   | 220     | 110,000    | 100 @ 200<br>200 @ 180<br>200 @ 220 | 200<br>180<br>220          | 20,000<br>36,000<br>44,000=100,000            |
| Jun 1   | Purchase    | 400   | 250     | 100,000   | 100 @ 200<br>200 @ 180<br>400 @ 250 | 200<br>180<br>250          | 20,000<br>36,000<br>100,000=156,000            |
| Jun 15  | Issue       | 600   | 400 @ 250<br>200 @ 220 | 144,000    | 100 @ 200<br>200 @ 180 | 200<br>180           | 20,000<br>36,000=56,000            |

Here we will first use the recent purchase to issue and then we will use the previous month's balance to issue.

**Summary:**

*   Total Purchases: ₹840,000
*   Total Issues (Material Consumption): ₹784,000
*   Ending Inventory Value: ₹56,000


### LIFO and Tax Implications (U.S. Only)

It's crucial to understand that the tax advantages of LIFO are primarily applicable in the United States. In most other countries, LIFO is not permitted for tax purposes.

### LIFO Layers

As shown in the example, under LIFO, the ending inventory can consist of layers of inventory purchased at different costs. These layers can persist for many years, especially if inventory levels remain relatively stable or increase.

In summary, LIFO can offer tax advantages in specific circumstances (primarily in the U.S. during periods of rising prices), but it also has drawbacks, including lower reported income and a potentially unrealistic balance sheet inventory value. Its complexity and limited international acceptance make it less commonly used than FIFO.
