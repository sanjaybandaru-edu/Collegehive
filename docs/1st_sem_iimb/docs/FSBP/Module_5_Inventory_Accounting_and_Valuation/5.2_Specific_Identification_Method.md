## The Specific Identification Method

The specific identification method assigns a specific cost to each individual item in inventory. This method is used when each item can be uniquely identified, such as with serial numbers, barcodes, or other tracking systems.

### Example: Inventory at the End of June

Assume a company has 300 units in inventory at the end of June. Using the specific identification method, it's determined that:

*   100 units were purchased in June at ₹250/unit.
*   200 units were purchased in May at ₹220/unit.

### Calculating Closing Inventory Value

The closing inventory value is calculated by multiplying the number of units from each purchase by their respective purchase prices and then summing the results:

(100 units \* ₹250/unit) + (200 units \* ₹220/unit) = ₹25,000 + ₹44,000 = ₹69,000

Therefore, the closing inventory value is ₹69,000.

### Calculating Material Consumption (Cost of Goods Sold in Manufacturing)

In a manufacturing context, the cost of goods issued to the production department is often referred to as "material consumption." This is analogous to the cost of goods sold (COGS) in a merchandising business.

If the total purchase value (across all periods) is ₹840,000, then the material consumption can be calculated as follows:

Total Purchase Value - Closing Inventory Value = Material Consumption

₹840,000 - ₹69,000 = ₹771,000

Therefore, the material consumption is ₹771,000.

### Suitability of the Specific Identification Method

The specific identification method is most suitable under the following conditions:

*   **Small Number of Units:** When the inventory consists of a relatively small number of high-value items. This makes tracking each item feasible.
*   **Unique Identification:** When each item can be uniquely identified using serial numbers, barcodes, or other tracking technologies.
*   **High-Value Items:** When the cost of individual items is significant enough to justify the effort of tracking them individually. Examples include:
    *   Jewelry
    *   Automobiles
    *   Real estate
    *   Custom-made goods
