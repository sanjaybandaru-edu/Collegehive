Here are certain points and steps to be kept in mind:-
* 1.	Since all the revenue is recognized after completion of 3 years, so the cost incurred will be shown in work in progress.
(Year1-20, Year2-30, Year-3=40)
* 2.	All the amount received from customer will be treated as advance (liability) till 3 years.
(Year1=10, Year2=20, Year3=30)
* 3.	Once the work is completed, the work in progress will be transferred to cost of sales leaving the work in progress balance 0. 
* 4.	Now, the total revenue earned will be recognized with receivables which leaves the profit of 10lakhs.
* 5.	The advance that was received from the customers will now go in receivables account (60 lakhs) , leaving a balance of 40 lakhs in the receivables account. 
* 6.	And finally the 40lakhs received in 4th year will be recorded and leave zero balance in receivables account.
