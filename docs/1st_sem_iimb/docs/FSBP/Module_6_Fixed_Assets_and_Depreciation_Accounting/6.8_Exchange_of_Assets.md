# Accounting for Asset Exchanges

## Exchange of Similar Assets

When an old asset is exchanged for a new asset that performs the same function (e.g., replacing an old drilling machine with a new one), no gain or loss is recognized at the time of the exchange. The cost of the new asset is determined by the net book value of the old asset plus any cash paid.

**Example:**

*   Old Drilling Machine:
    *   Cost: ₹20 lakhs
    *   Accumulated Depreciation: ₹15 lakhs
    *   Net Book Value: ₹5 lakhs
*   New Drilling Machine:
    *   List Price: ₹32 lakhs (Irrelevant for accounting)
    *   Exchange Price: ₹25 lakhs (Plus the old machine)

**Accounting Entries:**

1.  Remove Old Machine's Cost:
    *   Credit: Old Drilling Machine ₹20 lakhs

2.  Remove Accumulated Depreciation:
    *   Debit: Accumulated Depreciation ₹15 lakhs

3.  Record Cash Payment:
    *   Credit: Cash ₹25 lakhs

4.  Record New Machine's Cost:
    *   Debit: New Drilling Machine ₹30 lakhs (₹5 lakhs + ₹25 lakhs)

**Journal Entry:**

| Account                     | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) |
|------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Accumulated Depreciation     | 15,00,000  |            |
| Cash                         |           | 25,00,000  |
| Old Drilling Machine        |           | 20,00,000  |
| New Drilling Machine        | 30,00,000  |            |

**Explanation:** The new machine is recorded at a cost of ₹30 lakhs, which is the net book value of the old machine (₹5 lakhs) plus the cash paid (₹25 lakhs). No gain or loss is recognized.

## Exchange of Dissimilar Assets

When an old asset is exchanged for a new asset that performs a different function (e.g., exchanging a drilling machine for a packing machine), the exchange is treated as a sale of the old asset and a purchase of the new asset. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset received and the net book value of the asset given up.

**Example:**

*   Old Drilling Machine:
    *   Cost: ₹20 lakhs
    *   Accumulated Depreciation: ₹15 lakhs
    *   Net Book Value: ₹5 lakhs
*   New Packing Machine:
    *   Fair Value: ₹50 lakhs
    *   Exchange Price: Old drilling machine plus ₹42 lakhs

**Accounting Entries:**

1.  Remove Old Machine's Cost:
    *   Credit: Old Drilling Machine ₹20 lakhs

2.  Remove Accumulated Depreciation:
    *   Debit: Accumulated Depreciation ₹15 lakhs

3.  Record Cash Payment:
    *   Credit: Cash ₹42 lakhs

4.  Record New Packing Machine's Cost:
    *   Debit: New Packing Machine ₹50 lakhs (Fair Value)

5.  Recognize Gain on Disposal:
    *   Credit: Gain on Disposal of Drilling Machine ₹3 lakhs (₹50 lakhs - (₹5 lakhs + ₹42 lakhs) which can also be seen as ₹8 lakhs (Value given for old machine) - ₹5 lakhs (Net Book Value of old machine))

**Journal Entry:**

| Account                              | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Accumulated Depreciation             | 15,00,000  |            |
| Cash                                  |           | 42,00,000  |
| Old Drilling Machine                  |           | 20,00,000  |
| New Packing Machine                  | 50,00,000 |            |
| Gain on Disposal of Drilling Machine |           | 3,00,000   |

**Explanation:**

*   The new packing machine is recorded at its fair value (₹50 lakhs), *not* the seller's initial list price. An independent assessment of the fair value is crucial.
*   A gain of ₹3 lakhs is recognized. This represents the difference between the implied value received for the old machine (₹8 lakhs, because the seller reduced the price of the new machine by this amount) and its net book value (₹5 lakhs).
