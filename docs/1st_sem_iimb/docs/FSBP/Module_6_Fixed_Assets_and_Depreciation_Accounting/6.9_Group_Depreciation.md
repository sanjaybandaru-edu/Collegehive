# Group Depreciation

This document explains group depreciation, a method used when dealing with a large number of similar, low-value assets, such as computers in a large organization.

## The Need for Group Depreciation

When a company owns a vast number of similar assets (e.g., thousands of computers), tracking individual depreciation and disposal becomes impractical. Group depreciation simplifies this process by treating the entire group of assets as a single unit.

**Key Characteristics of Group Depreciation:**

*   Assets are treated as a single group, not individually.
*   A single depreciation rate is applied to the total cost of the group.
*   No gain or loss is recognized on the disposal of individual assets within the group.

## Example: Software Company's Computers

Let's consider a software company with a large number of computers:

**Year 1:**

*   Purchase: 100 computers @ ₹50,000 each = ₹50 lakhs
*   Journal Entry:
    *   Debit: Computers ₹50 lakhs
    *   Credit: Cash ₹50 lakhs
*   Depreciation (20% straight-line): ₹50 lakhs * 20% = ₹10 lakhs
*   Journal Entry:
    *   Debit: Depreciation Expense ₹10 lakhs
    *   Credit: Accumulated Depreciation ₹10 lakhs

**Year 2:**

*   Purchase: 200 computers @ ₹50,000 each = ₹100 lakhs
*   Journal Entry:
    *   Debit: Computers ₹100 lakhs
    *   Credit: Cash ₹100 lakhs
*   Total Computer Value (Beginning of Year 2): ₹50 lakhs + ₹100 lakhs = ₹150 lakhs
*   Depreciation: ₹150 lakhs * 20% = ₹30 lakhs
*   Journal Entry:
    *   Debit: Depreciation Expense ₹30 lakhs
    *   Credit: Accumulated Depreciation ₹30 lakhs

**Year 3:**

*   Purchase: 400 computers @ ₹50,000 each = ₹200 lakhs
*   Journal Entry:
    *   Debit: Computers ₹200 lakhs
    *   Credit: Cash ₹200 lakhs
*   Total Computer Value (Beginning of Year 3): ₹150 lakhs + ₹200 lakhs = ₹350 lakhs
*   Depreciation: ₹350 lakhs * 20% = ₹70 lakhs
*   Journal Entry:
    *   Debit: Depreciation Expense ₹70 lakhs
    *   Credit: Accumulated Depreciation ₹70 lakhs
*   Accumulated Depreciation Balance (End of Year 3): ₹10 lakhs + ₹30 lakhs + ₹70 lakhs = ₹110 lakhs

**Year 4: Exchange of Computers**

*   Exchange: 50 old computers for 400 new computers + ₹170 lakhs cash.
*   Journal Entry:
    *   Debit: Computers ₹170 lakhs
    *   Credit: Cash ₹170 lakhs
*   Total Computer Value (Beginning of Year 4): ₹350 lakhs + ₹170 lakhs = ₹520 lakhs
*   Depreciation: ₹520 lakhs * 20% = ₹104 lakhs
*   No gain or loss is recognized on the exchange of the 50 computers.

**Sale of an Individual Computer:**

If a single computer costing ₹50,000 is sold for ₹3,000, the entry is:

*   Debit: Cash ₹3,000
*   Credit: Computers ₹50,000
*   Credit: Accumulated Depreciation ₹47,000 (Balancing figure)

**Explanation:** The difference between the original cost and the cash received is treated as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation, rather than recognizing a gain or loss.

## Rationale and Alternatives

The rationale behind group depreciation is practicality. Managing individual records for a massive number of low-value assets is burdensome.

**Alternatives:**

*   **Individual Asset Tracking:** If accounting software allows efficient tracking of individual assets, or if the number of assets is manageable, individual depreciation and disposal accounting can be used.
*   **Composite Depreciation:** Similar to group depreciation, but used for assets that are dissimilar but have similar useful lives.
