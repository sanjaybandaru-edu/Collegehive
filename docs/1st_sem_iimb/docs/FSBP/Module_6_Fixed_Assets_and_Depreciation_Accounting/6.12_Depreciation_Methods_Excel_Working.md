# Accounting for Depreciation: Different Methods

This document explains the accounting entries for depreciation under different methods: Straight Line, Written Down Value (WDV), WDV transitioning to Straight Line (WDV-SL), and Sum of the Years' Digits (SYD).

**Scenario:**

*   Machine Cost: ₹10,00,000
*   Useful Life: 10 years (used for 12 years before disposal)

## 1. Straight Line Method

*   Depreciation Rate: 10% per year

**Accounting Entries:**

*   **Purchase of Machine:**

    | Account        | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) |
    | -------------- | --------- | ---------- |
    | Machine        | 10,00,000 |            |
    | Cash/Bank      |           | 10,00,000  |

*   **Depreciation (Years 1-10):** (Repeated annually)

    | Account                    | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) |
    | -------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
    | Depreciation Expense       | 1,00,000  |            |
    | Accumulated Depreciation |           | 1,00,000  |

*   **Years 11 & 12:** No depreciation is recorded as the asset is fully depreciated.

*   **Sale of Machine (End of Year 12):** Sale Price: ₹50,000

    | Account                    | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) |
    | -------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
    | Machine                    |           | 10,00,000  |
    | Accumulated Depreciation | 10,00,000 |            |
    | Cash/Bank                  | 50,000   |            |
    | Profit on Sale of Machine  |           | 50,000   |

**Explanation:**

*   Annual Depreciation: (₹10,00,000 / 10 years) = ₹1,00,000
*   At the end of year 10, accumulated depreciation is ₹10,00,000, resulting in a book value of ₹0.
*   The sale at ₹50,000 results in a profit of ₹50,000.

## 2. Written Down Value (WDV) Method

*   Depreciation Rate: 20% per year

**Accounting Entries:**

*   **Purchase of Machine:** (Same as Straight Line)

*   **Depreciation (Years 1-12):**

| Year | Beginning Book Value (₹) | Depreciation (₹) | Ending Book Value (₹) |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | 10,00,000               | 2,00,000         | 8,00,000              |
| 2    | 8,00,000                | 1,60,000         | 6,40,000              |
| 3    | 6,40,000                | 1,28,000         | 5,12,000              |
| 4    | 5,12,000                | 1,02,400         | 4,09,600              |
| 5    | 4,09,600                | 81,920          | 3,27,680              |

| 7    | 2,62,144                | 52,429          | 2,09,715              |
| 8    | 2,09,715                | 41,943          | 1,67,772              |

| 12   | 85,899                 | 17,180          | 68,719               |

*   **Sale of Machine (End of Year 12):** Sale Price: ₹50,000

    | Account                    | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) |
    | -------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
    | Machine                    |           | 10,00,000  |
    | Accumulated Depreciation | 9,31,281 |            |
    | Cash/Bank                  | 50,000   |            |
    | Loss on Sale of Machine  | 18,719 |            |

**Explanation:**

*   Depreciation is calculated on the *reducing* book value each year.
*   At the end of year 12, the book value is ₹68,719.
*   The sale at ₹50,000 results in a *loss* of ₹18,719.

## 3. WDV Transitioning to Straight Line (WDV-SL)

*   Initial Depreciation Rate: 20% (WDV)
*   Switch to Straight Line when annual depreciation under WDV falls below the equivalent straight-line depreciation (₹1,00,000).

**Accounting Entries:**

*   **Purchase of Machine:** (Same as previous methods)

*   **Depreciation (Years 1-4):** (WDV Method) (Same as first four years of WDV method)

*   **Year 5 Onwards:** Switch to straight line method. The remaining book value is divided by the remaining useful life.

| 1    | 10,00,000               | 2,00,000         | 8,00,000              | WDV    |

| 10   | 68,265                | 68,265         | 0              | SLM    |

*   **Sale of Machine (End of Year 12):** Sale Price: ₹50,000
