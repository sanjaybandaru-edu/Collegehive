# Accounting for Different Types of Fixed Assets

## Tangible Assets

Tangible assets have a physical form. Examples include:

*   Land
*   Buildings
*   Machinery
*   Natural Resources (e.g., coal mines, oil and gas fields)

**Cost Allocation:**

*   **Land:** Has an infinite life and is *not depreciated*.
*   **Buildings and Machinery:** Have a limited life and are *depreciated* over their useful life. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the asset's cost over its useful life.
*   **Natural Resources:** Are *depleted* over time, usually based on output (e.g., units extracted).

**Example of Depletion:**

If a coal mine has 100 units of coal reserves and 5 units are extracted in the first year, 5% of the mine's cost is depleted. If 20 units are extracted in the second year, 20% of the cost is depleted.

## Intangible Assets

Intangible assets lack physical substance but represent valuable rights or privileges. Examples include:

*   Patents
*   Copyrights
*   Goodwill

**Cost Allocation:**

*   **Intangible Assets with Definite Life (e.g., Patents):** Are *amortized* over their useful life (which may be shorter than their legal life).
    *   **Example:** A patent with a 20-year legal life but a 7-year expected useful life is amortized over 7 years.
*   **In-house Research and Development (R&D) Costs:** Generally *expensed* in the period incurred due to uncertainty about the research's success. However, costs of *purchased patents* can be capitalized.
*   **Intangible Assets with Indefinite Life (e.g., Goodwill):** Are *not amortized*. Instead, they are tested for *impairment* annually or when events indicate a potential decline in value.

**Goodwill:**

Goodwill arises when one company acquires another for a price exceeding the fair value of its net identifiable assets.

**Example of Goodwill Accounting:**

*   Seller's Net Asset Value: 500 crore
*   Buyer's Assessed Goodwill Value: 300 crore
*   Purchase Price: 800 crore

**Buyer's Accounting Entry:**

*   Debit: Land, Building, and other Assets (+500 crore)
*   Debit: Goodwill (+300 crore)
*   Credit: Cash (-800 crore)

**Impairment:**

Impairment occurs when an asset's recoverable amount (the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use) is less than its carrying amount (book value). If impairment occurs, the asset's value is written down, and a loss is recognized.

**Example of Impairment:**

If Coca-Cola stops selling a brand acquired earlier, the brand's value is impaired and must be written down.

## Deferred Charges (Deferred Expenses)

Deferred charges represent expenditures that provide benefits over multiple future periods. They are capitalized and then amortized over the periods they benefit.

**Examples of Deferred Charges:**

*   **Restructuring Costs:** If a company pays significant severance packages for layoffs associated with a restructuring, these costs can be deferred and amortized.
*   **Major Overhaul Expenses:** Significant maintenance or overhaul expenses (e.g., aircraft overhauls) can be capitalized and amortized.

**Example of Restructuring Costs:**

A company pays 500 crore in severance packages due to restructuring. It decides to amortize this cost over five years (100 crore per year).

*   Current Year: Expense 100 crore, carry 400 crore as a deferred charge asset.
*   Next Four Years: Amortize 100 crore each year.

| Asset Type                      | Cost Allocation Method |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Land                            | No Depreciation        |
| Buildings and Plant & Equipment | Depreciation            |
| Natural Resources               | Depletion              |
| Intangible Assets (Definite Life) | Amortization            |
| Intangible Assets (Indefinite Life, including Goodwill) | Impairment Testing (No Amortization) |
| Deferred Charges                | Amortization            |
| Research and Development (In-house) | Expense in the period incurred |
