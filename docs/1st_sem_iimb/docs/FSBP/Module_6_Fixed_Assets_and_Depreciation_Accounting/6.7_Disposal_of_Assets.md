# Accounting for Asset Disposal

## Cost Concept and Accumulated Depreciation

The cost concept dictates that assets are recorded at their historical cost. Depreciation is accumulated in a separate "Accumulated Depreciation" account, which is a contra-asset account. This means it has a negative balance and reduces the asset's net book value (carrying value) on the balance sheet.

**Example:**

*   Asset Cost: ₹10 lakhs
*   Depreciation Rate: 10% (Straight-line method)
*   Time Period: 6 years

At the end of six years, the balance sheet would show:

*   Asset: ₹10 lakhs
*   Accumulated Depreciation: ₹6 lakhs (₹1 lakh/year * 6 years)
*   Net Book Value: ₹4 lakhs (₹10 lakhs - ₹6 lakhs)
