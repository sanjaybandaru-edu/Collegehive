# Depreciation and Amortization: Matching Expenses with Revenue

Depreciation (for tangible assets) and amortization (for intangible assets) are accounting methods used to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life. This aligns with the matching principle, which dictates that expenses should be recognized in the same period as the related revenue they helped generate.

## The Matching Concept Explained

The matching concept ensures a more accurate representation of a company's profitability. Let's illustrate this with an example of two identical companies:

**Scenario:**

*   **Company 1:** Purchases a machine for ₹10 lakhs (10-year life).
*   **Company 2:** Leases the same machine for ₹1 lakh per year.
*   Both companies generate ₹6 lakhs in revenue and incur ₹4 lakhs in operating expenses (excluding depreciation/lease rent).

**Initial Profit Calculation (Without Depreciation):**

| Item            | Company 1 (Purchase) | Company 2 (Lease) |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Revenue         | ₹6 lakhs             | ₹6 lakhs           |
| Operating Exp.  | ₹4 lakhs             | ₹4 lakhs           |
| Lease Rent      | ₹0                   | ₹1 lakh           |
| **Profit**      | **₹2 lakhs**         | **₹1 lakh**       |

Based on this initial calculation, Company 1 appears more profitable. However, this is misleading because Company 1 hasn't accounted for the cost of using the machine.

**Corrected Profit Calculation (With Depreciation/Lease Rent):**

If Company 1 depreciates the machine over its 10-year life (₹10 lakhs / 10 years = ₹1 lakh per year), the profit calculation becomes:

| Item            | Company 1 (Purchase) | Company 2 (Lease) |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Revenue         | ₹6 lakhs             | ₹6 lakhs           |
| Operating Exp.  | ₹4 lakhs             | ₹4 lakhs           |
| Depreciation    | ₹1 lakh             | ₹0                 |
| Lease Rent      | ₹0                   | ₹1 lakh           |
| **Profit**      | **₹1 lakh**         | **₹1 lakh**       |

Now, both companies show the same profit, accurately reflecting their identical performance.

## Determining the Depreciation Amount

Several factors influence the depreciation amount:

1.  **Physical Life vs. Service Life:**

    *   **Physical Life:** The total time an asset can physically function.
    *   **Service Life (Useful Life):** The period an asset is expected to be economically useful to the company. This can be shorter than the physical life due to obsolescence or other factors.

2.  **Resale/Salvage Value:** The estimated value an asset will have at the end of its service life. If the amount is significant, it is called resale value. If it is negligible, it is called salvage value.

**Depreciation Calculation:**

Depreciation per year = (Cost of Asset - Resale/Salvage Value) / Service Life

**Example with Service Life and Resale Value:**

Assume:

*   Machine Cost: ₹10 lakhs
*   Service Life: 6 years
*   Resale Value: ₹1 lakh

Depreciation per year = (₹10 lakhs - ₹1 lakh) / 6 years = ₹1.5 lakhs per year


* The example above uses the **straight-line method**, where the same amount of depreciation is expensed each year.
