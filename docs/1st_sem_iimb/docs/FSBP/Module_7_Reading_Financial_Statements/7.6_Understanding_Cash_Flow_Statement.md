#  Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement explains the changes in a company's cash balance over a period. It summarizes all cash transactions, showing how the opening cash balance transitions to the closing cash balance.

## Basic Concept

If a business has an opening cash balance of ₹120 lakhs and a closing cash balance of ₹150 lakhs, the cash flow statement details how this ₹30 lakh increase occurred.

## Three Activities

1.  **Operating Activities:** Cash flows generated from the core business operations (manufacturing and selling paints and related services).
2.  **Investing Activities:** Cash flows related to the purchase and sale of long-term assets (machinery, equipment, financial assets).
3.  **Financing Activities:** Cash flows related to transactions with capital providers (borrowing, issuing equity, repaying loans, repurchasing shares, paying interest and dividends).
## Cash Flow from Operating Activities: Direct and Indirect Methods



### 1. Direct Method

The direct method is straightforward and easy to understand. It directly shows the cash inflows and outflows from operating activities.
**Example:**

*   **Cash Collection from Sales:** Includes cash sales and cash collected from customers on credit sales during the period.
*   **Cash Paid for Raw Material, Labor, and Other Expenses:** Represents payments to suppliers, employees, and other service providers.
*   **Net Cash from Operating Activities:** The difference between cash inflows (collections) and cash outflows (payments).

### 2. Indirect Method

The indirect method is more complex. It starts with profit after tax (calculated on an accrual basis) and adjusts it for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at cash from operating activities.

**Process:**

1.  **Start with Profit After Tax (PAT):** This is the net income from the income statement.
2.  **Add Back Non-Cash Expenses:** These are expenses that reduce profit but don't involve a cash outflow (e.g., depreciation, amortization).
3.  **Add Back Provisions and Other Liabilities:** These represent expenses recognized but not yet paid in cash.
4.  **Adjust for Changes in Current Assets and Liabilities:** These adjustments reflect the difference between accrual accounting and cash accounting.

**Example of Adjusting for Changes in Receivables:**

*   Opening Receivables: ₹100
*   Closing Receivables: ₹60
*   Credit Sales: ₹500

**Calculation of Cash Collected from Customers:**

Opening Receivables + Credit Sales - Cash Collected = Closing Receivables

₹100 + ₹500 - Cash Collected = ₹60

Cash Collected = ₹100 + ₹500 - ₹60 = ₹540

**Explanation:**

*   The income statement recognizes ₹500 as revenue (credit sales).
*   However, the actual cash collected is ₹540.
*   The difference (₹40) is due to the decrease in receivables (₹100 - ₹60).
*   By adding back the decrease in receivables (₹40) to the sales value (₹500), we arrive at the cash collected (₹540).

**General Rule for Adjustments:**

*   **Decrease in Current Assets (e.g., Receivables, Inventory):** Add back to PAT.
*   **Increase in Current Assets:** Deduct from PAT.
*   **Increase in Current Liabilities (e.g., Payables):** Add back to PAT.
*   **Decrease in Current Liabilities:** Deduct from PAT.
  
## Cash Flow from Investing Activities: Asian Paints

**What are Investing Activities?**

Investing activities represent the cash flows related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets, such as:

*   Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)
*   Investments in other companies (e.g., stocks, bonds)
*   Loans made to others

These activities are crucial for a company's future growth and profitability.

**Analysis of Asian Paints' Investing Activities:**

**Key Observations:**

*   **Significant Decrease in PP&E Spending:** Asian Paints significantly reduced its spending on PP&E in the current year. The expenditure decreased from ₹1067.26 crore in the previous year to ₹306.43 crore in the current year. This could indicate several things:
    *   **Completion of Major Projects:** The company may have completed significant expansion or modernization projects in the previous year, leading to reduced capital expenditure in the current year.
    *   **Focus on Efficiency:** The company might be focusing on improving the efficiency of its existing assets rather than investing in new ones.
    *   **Economic Downturn:** A potential economic downturn could have prompted the company to reduce capital spending to conserve cash.
    *   **Strategic Shift:** The company may have shifted its strategic focus away from heavy investment in physical assets.



# Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Financing activities involve transactions related to how a company raises capital. These include:

*   **Cash Inflows:**
    *   Borrowing (loans, bonds)
    *   Issuing new equity (stock)
*   **Cash Outflows:**
    *   Repaying loans
    *   Repurchasing shares (stock buybacks)
    *   Lease payments (if the lease is a financing lease)
    *   Interest payments
    *   Dividend payments

## Ideal Cash Flow Pattern

An ideal cash flow scenario for a healthy, growing company is often described as:

*   **Positive Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** Indicates the core business is generating cash.
*   **Negative Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** Suggests the company is investing in long-term assets for future growth.
*   **Positive Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** Implies the company is raising capital to fund its investments and operations.

## Detecting Earnings Management (Window Dressing)

Cash flow analysis can help detect potential earnings management, where companies manipulate their reported profits to appear more financially sound. One method involves comparing *Adjusted Accrual Profit (AAP)* with *Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)*.

**Calculating Adjusted Accrual Profit (AAP):**

1.  **Start with PBDIT (Profit Before Depreciation, Interest, and Taxes):** This is taken from the income statement.
2.  **Adjust for Investing-Related Income:** Subtract dividend and interest received, as these are part of investing activities, not core operations. Also subtract income from other investments.
3.  **Adjust for Taxes:** Deduct current income tax. *Do not deduct deferred taxes* as they are not actual cash outflows.

**Comparing AAP and CFO:**

*   **Small Gap:** A small difference between AAP and CFO is generally acceptable and suggests that reported profits are largely reflected in actual cash generated.
*   **Large Gap or Divergence:** A large gap or a situation where AAP is positive but CFO is negative raises concerns. This could indicate:
    *   **Aggressive accounting practices:** Recognizing revenue prematurely or delaying expense recognition.
    *   **Manipulating profit figures:** Artificially inflating profits through various accounting techniques.
