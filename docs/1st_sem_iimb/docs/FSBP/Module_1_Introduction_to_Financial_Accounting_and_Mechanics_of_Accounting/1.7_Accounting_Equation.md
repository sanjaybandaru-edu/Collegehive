# Accounting Equation 

## The Accounting Equation

The basic accounting equation is:

**Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity**

This can be expanded to include revenue and expenses:

**Assets = Liabilities + (Equity Share Capital + Revenue - Expenses - Dividends)**

This expanded equation shows how revenue increases owner's equity (profit) and how expenses and dividends decrease it.
