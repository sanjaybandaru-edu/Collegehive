# Double-entry System of Bookkeeping 
* Bookkeeping is the systematic recording of transactions in the book of accounts. These transactions are usually supported by source documents like invoices (bills), receipts, and vouchers.

## The Double Entry System:

The core principle of the double entry system is that every transaction has two sides Debit and Credit.

### For example:
* Buying raw materials on credit: Increases the raw materials asset account (debit) and accounts payable (credit).
* Paying for raw materials with cash: Increases the raw materials asset account (debit) and decreases the cash asset account (credit).
This system ensures proper recording of transactions by avoiding mistakes through cross-checking.
### Process:
 * Source Document: A transaction occurs, and a source document is
generated (e.g., invoice, receipt).
*  Recording: The bookkeeper records the transaction in the books of
accounts using the double-entry method. This is often done using
accounting software.
* Posting: At the end of a period, the transactions recorded in the books are
posted to the respective accounts (e.g., raw materials, cash, accounts
payable).
 * Financial Statement Preparation: The balances in these accounts are then
used to create financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash
flow statement).

and seen (e.g., buildings, machinery, cash, inventory).
* **Intangible Real Accounts:** Accounts for non-physical assets (e.g., patents,
copyrights, trademarks, goodwill, software licenses, spectrum licenses).
### 3. Nominal Accounts:
These accounts represent income, expenses, gains, and losses. They are
temporary accounts closed at the end of each accounting period. Examples
