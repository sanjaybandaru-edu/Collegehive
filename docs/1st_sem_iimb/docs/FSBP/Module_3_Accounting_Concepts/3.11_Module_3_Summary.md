# Summary of Accounting Concepts and Standards


## Accounting as the Language of Business

Accounting serves as the language of business, communicating a firm's performance through financial statements. Clear and consistent rules are essential for effective communication.

## Key Accounting Concepts

Ten core accounting concepts form the foundation of accounting principles:

1.  **Business Entity Concept:** The business is treated as a separate entity from its owners.
2.  **Money Measurement Concept:** Only transactions that can be expressed in monetary terms are recorded.
3.  **Going Concern Concept:** The business is assumed to continue operating indefinitely.
4.  **Accounting Period Concept:** The life of the business is divided into specific time periods for reporting.
5.  **Dual Aspect Concept:** Every transaction has two aspects, affecting at least two accounts.
6.  **Cost Concept:** Assets are recorded at their historical cost.
7.  **Matching Concept:** Expenses are recognized in the same period as the related revenues.
8.  **Conservatism Concept (Prudence):** Recognize losses when probable, but only recognize gains when realized.
9.  **Consistency Concept:** The same accounting methods should be used from period to period.
10. **Materiality Concept:** Only significant information needs to be disclosed.

**Emphasis on Key Concepts:**

The **Going Concern, Conservatism, and Matching Concepts** are particularly important in ensuring reliable and relevant financial reporting.

*   **Going Concern:** Justifies the valuation of assets based on their continued use rather than their liquidation value.
*   **Conservatism:** Leads to a cautious approach, preventing overstatement of assets and income.
*   **Matching:** Ensures that revenues and related expenses are recognized in the same accounting period, providing a more accurate picture of profitability.

## Relationship between Accounting Concepts and Standards

Accounting concepts provide the underlying principles, while **Accounting Standards** provide detailed rules and guidelines for applying those principles.

*   Concepts are the "why" behind the rules.
*   Standards are the "how" of applying the rules.

**Accounting Standards Board (ASB):**

The ASB is responsible for developing and publishing accounting standards. These standards provide specific guidance on:

*   Measurement
*   Recognition
*   Presentation
*   Disclosure of financial information

**Examples of Important Accounting Standards:**

*   **Revenue Recognition:** How and when revenue should be recognized.
*   **Inventory Valuation:** Methods for valuing inventory (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average).
*   **Fixed Asset Valuation:** Accounting for depreciation, impairment, and revaluation of fixed assets.
*   **Leased Assets:** Accounting for operating and finance leases.
*   **Cash Flow Statements:** Preparing statements of cash flows.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Accounting for complex financial instruments.

**Number of Accounting Standards:**

The ASB has published 38 accounting standards (the number may vary depending on the jurisdiction and updates).
