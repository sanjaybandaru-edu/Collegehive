# 1. Money Measurement Concept: 

The Money Measurement Concept (also known as the Monetary Unit Assumption) is a cornerstone of accounting. It dictates that only transactions and events that can be reliably expressed in monetary terms are recorded in the accounting books. This means that non-monetary aspects, even if crucial to a business's success, are not directly reflected in the financial statements.

**Why Accountants Prefer This Approach:**

*   **Objectivity:** Focusing on monetary transactions ensures objectivity and reduces subjectivity in financial reporting.
*   **Verifiability:** Monetary transactions are easily verifiable with invoices, receipts, and bank statements.
*   **Consistency:** Using a common monetary unit allows for consistent recording and comparison of financial data across different periods and businesses.

**Limitation:**

The limitation of the money measurement concept is that it doesn't capture the full picture of a business's value. Intangible assets like brand reputation, employee morale, and intellectual property are not directly reflected in the financial statements until they translate into measurable monetary outcomes. This is why supplemental disclosures and qualitative information are often included in company reports to provide a more holistic view.
