## Types of Information Search

### 1. **External vs Internal**
- **External Search**: 
  - Consumers seek information outside their knowledge base.
  - Example: Researching online, reading reviews, asking for recommendations.
  - Often required for complex or high-risk purchases.

- **Internal Search**: 
  - Consumers rely on their past experiences, memories, and knowledge.
  - Example: Choosing a favorite brand of toothpaste based on habit or preference.
  - Common for routine or low-risk purchases.

### 2. **Active vs Passive**
- **Active Search**: 
  - Consumers deliberately seek information.
  - Example: Browsing websites, visiting stores, or consulting experts.
  - Linked with external searches, particularly for high-involvement purchases.

- **Passive Search**: 
  - Consumers gather information without actively looking for it.
  - Example: Noticing ads or receiving recommendations in conversations.
  - Often linked with internal searches or long-term purchase considerations.
