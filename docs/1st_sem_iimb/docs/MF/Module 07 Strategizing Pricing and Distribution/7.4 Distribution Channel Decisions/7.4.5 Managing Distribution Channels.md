# 7.4.5 Managing Distribution Channels

Managing the members of the distribution channel is a crucial aspect of ensuring the success and effectiveness of the channel. Once you have selected the appropriate channel members, you must manage them by evaluating their performance, providing training and motivation, addressing channel conflicts, and making necessary adjustments based on changing circumstances.

## 1. **Evaluating Channel Members**

The first and most important step in managing distribution channel members is **evaluation**. You must continuously assess the performance of your channel members to determine whether they are meeting expectations. 

- For example, if you're supplying to 10 retailers, and 5 are performing well while the other 5 are not, you must decide whether to continue with the underperforming retailers or look for new ones.
- Similarly, if you have 10 franchisees and 8 are doing well, but 2 are struggling, you need to determine whether to support the underperforming franchisees or replace them with new ones.

Evaluation is key to identifying areas for improvement and making informed decisions about the future of each member in the channel. Regular monitoring ensures that you are working with those who align with your objectives.

## 2. **Training and Motivation**

Even well-performing channel members may need **training** and **motivation**. The goal is to ensure they are continuously aligned with the business's goals and deliver the best results.

- **Training**: Many channel members may not have experience in running every aspect of the business. They may need training in product knowledge, sales techniques, customer service, and operational procedures.
- **Motivation**: Providing motivation ensures that your channel members remain focused on growing the business. Offering incentives, rewards, or recognition can drive them to perform at their best and achieve better results.

By ensuring that your channel members are well-trained and motivated, you create a more productive and committed network.

## 3. **Addressing Channel Conflict**

**Channel conflict** occurs when different members of the distribution network face disagreements or issues that hinder the smooth operation of the distribution process. These conflicts can arise from a variety of sources:

- **Territorial Conflicts**: For example, one franchisee might complain that another is encroaching on their territory, leading to competition for the same customers.
- **Price Conflicts**: The same product might be sold at different prices across different channels. This could be due to one channel offering discounts while another does not, which could lead to customer confusion or dissatisfaction.
- **Manpower Issues**: Sometimes, conflicts arise because one distributor or showroom offers higher salaries or better incentives, luring away employees from another distributor, leaving the original business understaffed and unable to operate effectively.

Itâ€™s important to recognize and resolve these conflicts promptly to maintain harmony within the distribution channel. This might require mediation or intervention from the higher levels of the brand or manufacturer to ensure a fair and balanced approach.

## 4. **Updating and Modifying Channels**

Based on the evaluation of channel members and resolution of conflicts, you may need to **update** or **modify** your distribution channel. This could involve:

- **Removing underperforming members**: If certain members are not performing as expected, you may need to replace them or terminate their partnership.
- **Introducing new members**: If new channel opportunities arise, such as online platforms or alternative retail models, you may want to explore these options to reach a broader customer base.
- **Adapting to changing customer or market demands**: Changes in customer preferences or market conditions might necessitate a shift in the type of channel members you work with, such as incorporating more tech-driven or e-commerce-focused members.
  
Modifying your distribution channel structure ensures that you remain competitive and responsive to market changes, customer expectations, and internal performance.

## Conclusion

Managing the members of a distribution channel is an ongoing process that involves continuous **evaluation**, **training**, and addressing **conflicts**. By staying proactive and flexible in managing your channel, you can ensure that it operates efficiently and continues to meet the objectives of your business. If needed, don't hesitate to update or modify your distribution strategy to align with evolving market conditions and customer needs.
