# 7.1.1 Framework of Pricing

## The Price-Quality Matrix Overview

The price-quality matrix is a framework used to analyze market strategies based on the price and quality of products. In this matrix:

- **X-axis**: Price (Low, Medium, High)
- **Y-axis**: Quality (Low, Medium, High)

### Categories and Strategies

1. **High Price - High Quality**: **Premium Strategy**
   - Example: Apple products
   - Focus: High price justified by exceptional quality and brand value.

2. **High Price - Medium Quality**: **Overcharging Strategy**
   - Focus: High price not commensurate with the quality offered.

3. **High Price - Low Quality**: **Rip-Off Strategy**
   - Focus: Products priced high but offering poor quality.

4. **Medium Price - High Quality**: **High-Value Strategy**
   - Common in FMCG, durable goods, and food produce.
   - Example: Quality products at reasonable prices that emphasize value.

5. **Medium Price - Medium Quality**: **Medium-Value Strategy**
   - Focus: Balanced price and quality for mid-range consumers.

6. **Medium Price - Low Quality**: **False Economic Strategy**
   - Focus: Consumers may perceive value initially but eventually find poor quality disappointing.

7. **Low Price - High Quality**: **Super-Value Strategy**
   - Example: Exceptional quality at affordable prices, offering significant value.

8. **Low Price - Medium Quality**: **Good-Value Strategy**
   - Focus: Affordable products with acceptable quality for value-seeking consumers.

9. **Low Price - Low Quality**: **Economic Strategy**
   - Example: Products designed for budget-conscious consumers, prioritizing cost over quality.

## Why There’s No Universal Agreement on Strategies

While price (high, medium, low) is objectively measurable, **quality** is subjective and depends on **customer perception**. 

### Quality and Customer Perspective
- **Quality is conformance to requirements**: Customers define quality based on their specific expectations and needs.
- Example: The quality of drinking water differs based on context (flight, train, or road trip).

### Segmentation and Quality
- A premium customer may perceive medium-quality as insufficient, while a low-end customer might view medium-quality as high.
- Thus, customer **segment** drives the perception of quality.

## Case Study: Tata Nano

The Tata Nano was launched as a low-cost car targeting two-wheeler users, with a strategy of **low price and medium quality** (Good-Value Strategy). 

### The Marketing Failure
- **Positioning Problem**:
  - Marketed as a "cheap vehicle."
  - Associated with affordability, which led to perceptions of compromise in safety and quality.
  - Customers did not want to be seen as owning the "poor man’s car."
- **Mismatch with Target Audience**:
  - Intended buyers (two-wheeler users) avoided the product due to the stigma.
  - Actual buyers were higher-income families who treated it as a second or third car.
- **Outcome**:
  - Despite affordability, the car failed to appeal due to poor positioning and branding.

### Key Takeaways
- Customers prefer bargains (high quality at lower prices) over cheap products.
- Positioning affects perception: The Nano’s "1 lakh car" label highlighted its low price instead of its value.
