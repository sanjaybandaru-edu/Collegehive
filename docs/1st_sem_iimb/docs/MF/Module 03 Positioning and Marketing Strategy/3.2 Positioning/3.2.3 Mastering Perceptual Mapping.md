# 3.2.3 Mastering Perceptual Mapping

## Overview
Positioning involves creating a clear, distinctive image of a product or service in the consumer's mind. Perceptual mapping is a powerful tool that helps marketers visually understand consumer preferences, evaluate brand attributes, and define competitive positioning.

## Steps in Positioning

### 1. **Collecting Preference Data**
- Conduct surveys to gather consumer preferences for different brands.
- Respondents rank brands on a scale (e.g., 1-10) based on their preferences.
- **Example**:
  - Brand preferences (e.g., Saab, G20, BMW, Ford).
  - Respondent scores (e.g., Audi = 8, Toyota = 3 for Respondent 1).

---

### 2. **Creating a Preference Map**
- Plot consumer preferences for various brands.
- **Visualization**:
  - Blue squares represent **consumers**.
  - Red dots represent **brands**.
- **Insights**:
  - Brands with clusters of consumers around them are preferred.
  - Brands with fewer consumers around them are less preferred.

### 3. **Collecting Perceptual Data**
- Conduct surveys to gather consumer perceptions of brands based on attributes.
- Attributes include factors like "attractive," "roomy," "prestige," "unreliable," etc.
- Respondents rate brands on each attribute using a scale (e.g., 1-10).
- **Example**:
  - G20 rated **5.6** for "attractive," **6.3** for "quiet."
  - Ford rated **4** for "attractive," **3.2** for "quiet."

---

### 4. **Creating a Perceptual Map**
- Plot the brands based on their association with attributes.
- **Visualization**:
  - Red dots represent **brands**.
  - Blue lines represent **attributes**.
- **Insights**:
  - Positive attributes (e.g., "prestige," "roomy," "quiet") cluster around top brands like BMW, Audi, Toyota.
  - Negative attributes (e.g., "unreliable," "poorly built") cluster around less preferred brands like Ford, Mercury.

---

### 5. **Combining Preference and Perception**
- Overlay consumer preferences, brand positions, and attributes on a single map.
- **Visualization**:
  - Red dots = **Brands**.
  - Blue lines = **Attributes**.
  - Pink lines = **Consumers**.
- **Insights**:
  - Consumers gravitate toward brands associated with positive attributes.
  - Brands with negative attributes attract fewer consumers.

## Interpreting Perceptual Maps

1. **Understanding Current Market Dynamics**:
   - Identify clusters of consumers and brands.
   - Recognize the attributes associated with preferred and less-preferred brands.

2. **Evaluating Market Opportunities**:
   - Identify unoccupied spaces on the map (attribute gaps).
   - Evaluate whether your product can fill a niche or differentiate itself effectively.

3. **POP (Point of Parity) and POD (Point of Difference)**:
   - Use the map to identify:
     - **POP**: Attributes shared with competitors to ensure legitimacy.
     - **POD**: Unique attributes to differentiate the product.

4. **Making Strategic Decisions**:
   - **POP Strategy**: Position your product as equivalent to a strong brand but with a price or value advantage.
   - **POD Strategy**: Focus on attributes not occupied by competitors (e.g., "easy service" if unaddressed).

## Example Analysis

### Scenario 1: New Brand in a Competitive Market
- **Map Insight**: Most customers and positive attributes are clustered around brands like BMW and Audi.
- **Strategy**: Focus on POD such as "easy service," an unoccupied attribute on the map.

### Scenario 2: New Brand in an Underserved Market
- **Map Insight**: Top brands occupy only 20% of the market, leaving room for new entrants.
- **Strategy**: Use POP to align with established brands but offer a competitive edge, such as lower price or additional features.
