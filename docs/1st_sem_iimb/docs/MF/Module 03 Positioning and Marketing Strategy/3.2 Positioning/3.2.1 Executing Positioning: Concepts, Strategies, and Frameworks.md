# 3.2.1 Executing Positioning: Concepts, Strategies, and Frameworks

## Overview
Positioning is the process of creating a distinctive image of a product or service in the mind of the target consumer. It ensures that the differentiation created (product-based, price-based, place-based, etc.) is communicated effectively to consumers so they perceive the intended value.

## Definition of Positioning

- **Positioning** is the act of designing a company’s offering and image to occupy a unique and meaningful place in the mind of the target market.
- The goal is to locate the brand in the consumer’s mind in a way that maximizes the benefit to the company.

### Key Definitions
1. **Al Ries and Jack Trout (1969)**:
   - Positioning is not what you do to a product; it is what you do to the mind of the prospect.
   - The product is positioned in the consumer's mind.

2. **Levin and Gatti (1969)**:
   - Differentiation of brands by studying how consumer perceptions of various brands differ is termed product positioning.

3. **Philip Kotler**:
   - Market positioning is arranging for a product to occupy a clear, distinctive, and desirable place in the target market's mind.

## How to Achieve Positioning
### 1. **Perceptual Mapping**
- A visual technique to understand consumer perceptions of products or brands in comparison to competitors.
- Represents the differentiation and competitive positioning in the consumer’s mind.

- **Process**:
  1. Conduct surveys to gather consumer perceptions and preferences.
  2. Use statistical tools (e.g., factor analysis, cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling) to analyze data.
  3. Plot the results on a map:
     - **2D Map**: Based on two parameters.
     - **3D or Multi-Dimensional Map**: Based on three or more parameters.
  4. Visualize the position of your product compared to competitors.
- **Objective**: Test if the differentiation created is recognized and valued by consumers.

### 2. **POP (Point of Parity) and POD (Point of Difference) Analysis**

- **POP (Point of Parity)**:
  - Features or benefits that are shared with competitors.
  - Examples:
    - Refrigerators from different brands share basic cooling functionality.
    - Shampoo brands may all promise clean hair.
  - Establishes legitimacy and assures consumers that the product is comparable to alternatives.

- **POD (Point of Difference)**:
  - Features or benefits that are unique to the brand and highly desirable.
  - Examples:
    - Longer warranty periods.
    - Unique aroma or texture in FMCG products.
    - Superior fuel efficiency in a car.
  - **Criteria for POD**:
    1. **Relevance**: Desirable to consumers.
    2. **Deliverability**: Feasible for the company to provide.
    3. **Differentiation**: Must clearly stand out from competitors.

### 3. **Crafting the Positioning Statement**
- Focus on **1-2 key differences** for clarity and simplicity.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Keep it simple and easy to understand.
  - Highlight value that resonates with the target market.
  - Address the specific problem the consumer is trying to solve.
- **Example**:
  - **MOVE**: Positioned as a backache specialist rather than a general pain reliever.
  - **Milkmaid**: Repositioned multiple times to suit consumer needs:
    1. Whitener for tea and coffee.
    2. Substitute milk during shortages.
    3. Table topper for enhancing taste.
    4. Essential ingredient for desserts.

## Positioning Strategy Steps
1. **Competitive Frame of Reference**:
   - Identify competitors.
   - Analyze their offerings and compare with your product.

2. **POP and POD Analysis**:
   - Define similarities (POP) to ensure consumer trust.
   - Highlight differences (POD) that make your product unique and desirable.

3. **Create a Perceptual Map**:
   - Use data to visualize how your product is perceived relative to competitors.
   - Identify gaps in the market that your product can fill.

4. **Evaluate Positioning Strategy**:
   - Ensure the proposed positioning is understandable, relevant, and sustainable.
