# 3.2.1 Executing Positioning

**Introduction: Why Positioning Matters**

Imagine a crowded marketplace. How do you make your product stand out? That's the power of positioning. It's not just about what your product *is*, but what it *represents* in the minds of your target audience. Effective positioning ensures your brand is not just noticed, but also chosen. This section explores the core concepts, practical strategies, and frameworks you need to master to achieve this.

**What is Positioning? (Clear & Concise)**

Positioning is the strategic art of shaping how your product or service is perceived in the minds of your target customers. It's about creating a unique and desirable space for your brand, differentiating it from competitors. Think of it as crafting the "mental real estate" you want your brand to occupy.

**Key Definitions - Understanding the Experts:**

Let's look at what the experts have to say:

1.  **Al Ries and Jack Trout (1969):**
    *   _"Positioning is not what you do to a product; it's what you do to the *mind* of the prospect."_ This highlights that positioning is about *perception*, not just the product's features.
2.  **Levin and Gatti (1969):**
    *   Positioning is about "differentiating brands by studying how consumer perceptions of various brands differ." This emphasizes the *comparative* nature of positioning.
3.  **Philip Kotler:**
    *   "Market positioning is arranging for a product to occupy a clear, distinctive, and desirable place in the target market's mind." This encapsulates the essence of positioning: *clear, distinct, and desirable.*

**In short:** Positioning isn't about *making* a product better; it's about *making it seen* as better by the right people.

**How to Achieve Effective Positioning - Practical Strategies**

Here's where the rubber meets the road. How do we *actually* achieve effective positioning?

### 1. Perceptual Mapping: Seeing the Landscape

*   **What it is:** Perceptual mapping is a powerful visualization tool that helps you understand how consumers perceive your brand relative to your competitors. It's like creating a map of the marketplace as it exists in your customers' minds.
*   **Why it's useful:** It reveals competitive strengths and weaknesses and highlights opportunities for differentiation.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  **Gather data:** Conduct surveys or market research to understand consumer perceptions on key attributes relevant to your product category (e.g., price, quality, features, style, etc.).
    2.  **Analyze:** Use statistical techniques (like factor analysis, cluster analysis, or multidimensional scaling) to identify underlying patterns and dimensions.
    3.  **Visualize:** Plot the brands on a map using the chosen dimensions (e.g., "Price" on one axis and "Quality" on another).
        *   **2D maps** are common but you can create 3D or more complex maps for multi-dimensional analysis.
    4.  **Interpret:** Analyze the map to understand gaps and clusters. Where does your product fall? Are there unmet needs?
*   **Objective:** To visually determine if your intended positioning is aligned with how consumers actually perceive your brand and its competitors. Think of it as a diagnostic tool to validate your positioning efforts.

### 2. POP and POD Analysis: The Building Blocks of Differentiation

*   **POP (Points of Parity):**
    *   **What they are:** The essential attributes or benefits that your product *shares* with competitors. These are the "must-haves" that establish your product's legitimacy.
    *   **Why they're important:** Without POPs, consumers might not consider your product a viable option.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   A smartphone needs to make calls and access the internet (basic functions).
        *   A coffee shop needs to offer coffee and seating (basic offering).
*   **POD (Points of Difference):**
    *   **What they are:** The unique attributes or benefits that set your product *apart* from the competition. These are what make you compelling.
    *   **Why they're important:** They drive preference and are crucial for a brand's success.
    *   **Criteria for effective PODs:**
        1.  **Relevance:** Is it something consumers actually care about? (Desirable)
        2.  **Deliverability:** Can your company consistently and effectively deliver this benefit? (Feasible)
        3.  **Differentiation:** Does it genuinely set you apart from competitors in a meaningful way? (Unique)

   *   *The image visually demonstrates how POP and POD analysis work together: overlapping circles representing parity and a separate circle representing the point of difference. It highlights how a product can meet basic needs while also offering something unique.*

    *   *Identifying points of parity ensures your product is competitive, while points of difference create a compelling value proposition.*

### 3. Crafting the Positioning Statement: Your Brand's Message

*   **Focus:** Concentrate on **1-2 key differentiating points** to keep your message simple and memorable. Trying to be everything to everyone dilutes your message.
*   **Key Ingredients:**
    *   **Target audience:** Who are you talking to?
    *   **Category:** What market are you competing in?
    *   **Benefit:** What unique value do you provide?
*   **Guidelines:**
    *   **Clarity:** Easy to understand for both your team and your target market.
    *   **Relevance:** Resonates with the needs and desires of your target audience.
    *   **Focus:** Addresses a specific problem that your consumer is trying to solve.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **MOVE (Updated example):** "For those suffering from severe back pain, MOVE provides targeted relief, unlike general pain relievers." (Clearly positions as a specialist, targeting a specific need.)
    *   **Milkmaid (Updated example):** Shows that positioning can evolve:
        *   **Phase 1 (Early Days):** "Milkmaid: A convenient whitener for your tea and coffee." (Focus on basic function)
        *   **Phase 2 (Scarcity):** "Milkmaid: Your dependable milk substitute during shortages." (Addressing market needs)
        *   **Phase 3 (Culinary):** "Milkmaid: The secret ingredient for making richer, tastier desserts." (Focus on use cases)

**Positioning Strategy: A Step-by-Step Process**

1.  **Competitive Landscape Analysis:** Identify and analyze your competitors. What are their strengths, weaknesses, and target audiences?
2.  **POP and POD Deep Dive:** Determine what you need to offer to be competitive (POPs) and what makes you stand out (PODs).
3.  **Perceptual Mapping Implementation:** Utilize data to create a perceptual map visualizing your brandâ€™s positioning versus the competition.
4.  **Refine Positioning & Test:** Evaluate your positioning strategy. Is it clear, relevant, and most importantly, sustainable? Does it align with how consumers perceive your brand?
5.  **Communicate and Reinforce:** Use the positioning statement to guide all your marketing and communication efforts. Ensure consistent brand messaging.

Positioning isn't a one-time task but a continuous process. By understanding your target audience, your competitive landscape, and leveraging tools like perceptual mapping and POP/POD analysis, you can craft a strong position that resonates with your customers and drives success. It's about owning a unique space in the consumer's mind.
