# 3.4.2 Unpacking the BCG Matrix

## Strategic Business Units (SBUs)

### Characteristics of an SBU:
1. A single business or collection of related businesses.
2. Has its own competitors.
3. Operates under a defined leader or manager.
4. Responsible for strategic planning and profitability.

### Examples of SBUs:
- Individual brands (e.g., Lifebuoy, Surf Excel).
- Geographic regions (e.g., North, South, East, West).
- Distribution channels (e.g., Amazon, Walmart, Reliance).

## BCG Matrix

### Purpose
- Helps allocate resources to SBUs based on their market position.
- Simplifies decision-making on investment priorities.

### Structure
The BCG Matrix is a **2×2 grid** with the following axes:
- **X-axis**: Relative Market Share (Low to High).
- **Y-axis**: Market Growth Rate (Low to High).

### Quadrants:
1. **Stars**:
   - **High market share, High growth rate**.
   - Characteristics:
     - Requires significant investment to maintain leadership in a growing market.
     - Can transition into cash cows as market growth stabilizes.
   - Strategy: Invest heavily to sustain growth and market leadership.

2. **Cash Cows**:
   - **High market share, Low growth rate**.
   - Characteristics:
     - Generates steady cash flow with minimal investment.
     - Supports other SBUs requiring investment.
   - Strategy: Maintain position, minimize investment, and harvest returns.

3. **Question Marks**:
   - **Low market share, High growth rate**.
   - Characteristics:
     - Uncertain potential; requires careful evaluation before investment.
     - May transition to stars with investment or to dogs without.
   - Strategy: Selectively invest to convert into stars or divest if not promising.

4. **Dogs**:
   - **Low market share, Low growth rate**.
   - Characteristics:
     - Limited potential and often drains resources.
     - Unprofitable with minimal returns.
   - Strategy: Divest or allow natural decline.

## Example Interpretation of a BCG Matrix

1. **SBU Positions**:
   - **Stars**: Two SBUs, one large volume and one small volume.
   - **Cash Cow**: One large volume SBU generating maximum revenue.
   - **Question Marks**: Four SBUs with growth potential but requiring investment.
   - **Dogs**: One SBU with low returns, set for divestment.

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Use cash flow from cash cows to fund stars and selected question marks.
   - Avoid investing in dogs; allow natural decline.

## Advantages of the BCG Matrix
1. Simple visual representation of SBU performance.
2. Highlights the relationship between market share, growth, and resource allocation.
3. Facilitates strategic decisions for long-term planning.

## Disadvantages of the BCG Matrix
1. **Simplistic Approach**:
   - Only considers market share and growth rate; ignores other factors like competitive intensity, innovation, or brand equity.
2. **Rigidity**:
   - Assumes an SBU fits into one quadrant, whereas some may overlap (e.g., transitioning from question mark to star).
3. **Cash Flow Emphasis**:
   - Focuses heavily on cash generation and investment while neglecting other strategic dimensions.
4. **Assumption of Investment Success**:
   - Assumes direct correlation between investment and success, which may not always hold true.

## Connection to Market Size and Market Share Analysis
- **Market Size and Growth**:
  - BCG Matrix relies on market size and growth data to classify SBUs.
- **Market Share**:
  - Relative market share determines an SBU’s position on the X-axis of the matrix.
