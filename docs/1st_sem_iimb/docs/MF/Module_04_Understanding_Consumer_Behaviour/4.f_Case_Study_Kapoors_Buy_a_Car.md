# 4.5.3 Understanding Individual Contributions in Family Purchase Decisions

In this case, we analyze the consumer decision-making process of the Kapoor family while purchasing a new car. We explore the stages of decision-making and identify how different family members contribute to the purchase decision. The case reveals the family’s buying behavior, highlighting factors that influenced their choices, and provides insights into strategic implications for brands such as Melton Crusader, Amanda Falcon, and Humberland Compare.

---

## **Purchase Decision**
The Kapoor family eventually chose the **Melton's Crusader**. Key influencing factors were:

- **Test Drive**: The family had the chance to test the car, and the driving experience played a significant role in their decision. 
- **Salesmanship**: The persuasive sales pitch, which emphasized the car's benefits, could have influenced their choice.

### Financing
The Kapoor family took a loan to purchase the car, which highlights the financial commitment they were willing to make for this purchase.

### Post-Purchase Evaluation
Although it is too early to fully evaluate the car post-purchase, the family is generally happy with their choice. They are pleased with:
- **Better looks** than their previous car
- **Increased boot space**
- **Higher speed**
- **Enhanced driving experience**

However, the mother still has concerns about whether the car is worth the money in the long run, particularly with regard to **maintenance costs** and **value for money**.

---

## **Roles in the Decision-Making Process**
In this family, various members assume different roles in the decision-making process:

- **Initiator**: The son started the conversation about purchasing a new car.
- **Influencer**: Both the son and daughter were key influencers, providing opinions and information.
- **Decision Maker**: The father, Arun Kapoor, made the final decision, as he was the one funding the purchase.
- **Purchaser**: The father, Arun, is also the purchaser.
- **User**: The entire family will use the car, but primarily the father.

---

## **Positioning of Melton Crusader**
### Point of Parity and Point of Difference
- **Point of Parity**: Melton Crusader must offer similar functional features to its competitors, such as good mileage, space, and comfort.
- **Point of Difference**: The unique features or advantages that Melton Crusader had over the competition played a significant role in the Kapoor family’s decision. These could include aspects like superior handling, smoother ride, or other attributes that were better than those of competitors like **Amanda Falcon** and **Humberland Compare**.

### Influence of the Son
The son was the key influencer who persuaded the rest of the family to choose Melton Crusader. He researched and gathered information about various cars, becoming a **brand advocate** for the Crusader. This is similar to the concept of **influencer marketing**, where the son acted as an influencer within the family.

### Strategic Implications for Brands
- **Amanda Falcon** could have done more to engage the daughter, who was interested but did not have sufficient information or passion to advocate for the brand. The lack of enthusiasm and detailed information from the daughter contributed to Amanda Falcon’s failure to influence the family’s decision.
- **Humberland Compare** had a loyal user in the father, who had been using their car for years. However, Humberland Compare failed to convince him to buy another model. Despite his brand loyalty, factors like new features or emotional appeal from competitors like Melton Crusader ultimately swayed the decision.

### What Could Humberland Compare Have Done Differently?
1. **Targeting the Father’s Loyalty**: Humberland Compare could have leveraged the father’s loyalty to the brand. They might have highlighted improvements in their newer models or offered incentives such as trade-in options or discounts for loyal customers.
2. **Emotional Appeal**: They could have focused on appealing to the family’s emotional needs, showcasing how their model would better fit their lifestyle and needs (e.g., family trips, safety features).
3. **Family Engagement**: Similar to how the Melton Crusader engaged the son, Humberland Compare could have worked to engage all family members in the decision-making process, addressing their specific needs.

### **Pre-Purchase Information Search**
Each family member looked for different types of information:
- **Father**: Focused on functional aspects such as cost, mileage, and reliability.
