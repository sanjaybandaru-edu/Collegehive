## Criteria for Selecting a Target Segment
There are three major parameters or blocks of criteria for selecting a target market:

### 1. **Segment Size and Growth**
   - **Size**: 
     - What is the current size of the market?
     - A larger market size is typically preferred for profitability.
   - **Growth**: 
     - Consider the future potential of the market.
     - Avoid markets with limited or short-term growth prospects.

### 2. **Market Attractiveness**
   - Assess how attractive the market is based on its structure:
     - **Competitive Landscape**: Is there too much competition? Highly competitive markets may be less attractive despite their size.
     - **Barriers to Entry**: Are there barriers that can limit your ability to operate or grow in the segment?

### 3. **Organizational Objectives and Resources**
   - **Objectives**:
     - What is the organization aiming for? Examples include:
       - Growth
       - Market share
       - Revenue
       - Profit
       - Customer satisfaction
   - **Resources**:
     - Does the organization have the necessary resources to achieve its objectives in the chosen segment? Examples include:
       - Manpower
       - Financial power
       - Technology solutions
   - Alignment: Even if a market is large and attractive, it is not viable if the organization's resources are insufficient to capture and serve the market effectively.

# 2.3.2 Segment Size and Attrativeness

## Segment Size and Growth

### 1. **Segment Size**
- **Definition**: The current demand potential for a product or service within a specific market segment.
- **Process**:
  1. Take a sample from the geographical area of focus.
  2. Collect data on:
     - Purchase intention.
     - Willingness to pay.
     - Ability to pay.
  3. Extrapolate the sample data to estimate the demand potential for the entire population.
- **Methods**:
  - Surveys.
  - Statistical analysis.

### 2. **Segment Growth**
- **Definition**: The expected rate of growth of the market segment over a future period.
- **Factors to Consider**:
  - Demographic trends (e.g., age group growth in a region).
  - Data from government census, research papers, journals, or articles.
- **Evaluation**:
  - If the segment size remains stagnant over time, it indicates poor growth potential.
  - Measure growth rates (e.g., 2%, 5%, 10% over 5 years) to assess the viability of the segment.

## Structural Attractiveness (External Analysis)

Structural attractiveness determines how conducive a market segment is for sustained profitability. It can be analyzed using **Michael Porterâ€™s Five Forces Model**.

### Michael Porter's Five Forces
1. **Threat of New Entrants**:
   - **Definition**: The ease with which new competitors can enter the market.
   - **Implications**:
     - High threat: Market becomes less attractive due to competition increasing and profits diminishing.
     - Low threat: Attractive market with limited new entrants.
   - **Barriers to Entry**:
     - **High**: Requires heavy regulations, investments, technology, or specialized manpower (e.g., pharmaceuticals, steel).
     - **Low**: Minimal requirements to enter (e.g., retail businesses).

2. **Threat of Intense Segment Rivalry**:
   - **Definition**: The degree of competition within the segment.
   - **Entry vs. Exit Barriers**:
     - **Entry Barrier**: How easy it is to start competing in the market.
     - **Exit Barrier**: How easy it is to leave the market.
   - **Implications**:
     - High rivalry and low exit barriers lead to overcapacity and reduced profitability.
     - Ideal: High entry barriers and low exit barriers.
   - **Examples**:
     - Retail businesses: Low exit barriers; easy to leave.
     - Established brands: High exit barriers due to existing investments (e.g., manufacturing plants, customer base).

3. **Threat of Substitute Products**:
   - **Definition**: The availability of alternative products that customers can switch to.
   - **Implications**:
     - High threat: Market becomes less attractive as customers can easily shift preferences (e.g., tea vs. coffee).
     - Low threat: Market becomes more attractive when substitutes are limited or non-existent.

4. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**:
   - **Definition**: The ability of customers to influence prices or terms.
   - **Factors**:
     - **B2B (Business to Business)**: Buyers often have significant power due to bulk purchasing.
     - **B2C (Business to Consumer)**: Individual buyers typically have less power, but this may change with social media influence.
   - **Modern Context**:
     - Individual consumers can influence businesses via viral social media campaigns, increasing their effective bargaining power.

5. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**:
   - **Definition**: The ability of suppliers to influence costs or terms.
   - **Factors**:
     - Dependence on suppliers for critical resources (e.g., raw materials, logistics).
     - Consolidation of suppliers (e.g., unions or fleets in delivery services).
   - **Implications**:
     - High bargaining power of suppliers reduces market attractiveness as they can dictate terms (e.g., Zomato's dependence on delivery partners).

---

## Ideal Conditions for Attractive Segments
- **Low Threat of New Entrants**: High entry barriers protect profitability.
- **Low Threat of Intense Segment Rivalry**: Limited competition ensures sustainable margins.
- **Low Threat of Substitutes**: Unique value proposition reduces customer switching.
- **Low Bargaining Power of Buyers**: Limits customer influence on pricing.
- **Low Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: Ensures manageable input costs.

> **Note**: A utopian market with all conditions perfectly favorable does not exist. Instead, compare segments to identify the one with the best overall balance across these parameters.

## Targeting Strategies
After selecting the target segment, marketers can adopt one of the following targeting strategies:

  - Cosmetics for adult women.
  - Apparels for elder women.
- **Benefits**:
  - Spreads risk across segments.
  - Higher market reach.
- **Drawback**: Requires more resources to manage multiple segments.

### 3. **Product Specialization**
- **Definition**: Focus on one product type for all segments.
- **Example**: Selling cosmetics for teens, adults, and elders.

  - Expertise in a specific product category.
  - Efficient production and marketing processes.
- **Drawback**: Risk if demand for the product decreases across segments.

### 4. **Market Specialization**
- **Definition**: Satisfy all the needs of one specific segment.

### 5. **Full Market Coverage**
