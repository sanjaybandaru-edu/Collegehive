# 3.2.1 Executing Positioning: Concepts, Strategies, and Frameworks

## Overview
Positioning is the process of creating a distinctive image of a product or service in the mind of the target consumer. It ensures that the differentiation created (product-based, price-based, place-based, etc.) is communicated effectively to consumers so they perceive the intended value.

---

## Definition of Positioning

- **Positioning** is the act of designing a company’s offering and image to occupy a unique and meaningful place in the mind of the target market.
- The goal is to locate the brand in the consumer’s mind in a way that maximizes the benefit to the company.

### Key Definitions
1. **Al Ries and Jack Trout (1969)**:
   - Positioning is not what you do to a product; it is what you do to the mind of the prospect.
   - The product is positioned in the consumer's mind.

2. **Levin and Gatti (1969)**:
   - Differentiation of brands by studying how consumer perceptions of various brands differ is termed product positioning.

3. **Philip Kotler**:
   - Market positioning is arranging for a product to occupy a clear, distinctive, and desirable place in the target market's mind.

## How to Achieve Positioning
### 1. **Perceptual Mapping**
- A visual technique to understand consumer perceptions of products or brands in comparison to competitors.

- **Process**:
  1. Conduct surveys to gather consumer perceptions and preferences.
  2. Use statistical tools (e.g., factor analysis, cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling) to analyze data.
  3. Plot the results on a map:
     - **2D Map**: Based on two parameters.
     - **3D or Multi-Dimensional Map**: Based on three or more parameters.
  4. Visualize the position of your product compared to competitors.
- **Objective**: Test if the differentiation created is recognized and valued by consumers.

### 2. **POP (Point of Parity) and POD (Point of Difference) Analysis**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24dcc903-1600-44db-aeb2-37757ba5d5c5)

- **POP (Point of Parity)**:
  - Features or benefits that are shared with competitors.
  - Examples:
    - Refrigerators from different brands share basic cooling functionality.
    - Shampoo brands may all promise clean hair.
  - Establishes legitimacy and assures consumers that the product is comparable to alternatives.

- **POD (Point of Difference)**:
  - Features or benefits that are unique to the brand and highly desirable.
  - Examples:
    - Longer warranty periods.
    - Unique aroma or texture in FMCG products.
    - Superior fuel efficiency in a car.
  - **Criteria for POD**:
    1. **Relevance**: Desirable to consumers.
    2. **Deliverability**: Feasible for the company to provide.
    3. **Differentiation**: Must clearly stand out from competitors.

---

### 3. **Crafting the Positioning Statement**
- Focus on **1-2 key differences** for clarity and simplicity.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Keep it simple and easy to understand.
  - Highlight value that resonates with the target market.
  - Address the specific problem the consumer is trying to solve.
- **Example**:
  - **MOVE**: Positioned as a backache specialist rather than a general pain reliever.
  - **Milkmaid**: Repositioned multiple times to suit consumer needs:
    1. Whitener for tea and coffee.
    2. Substitute milk during shortages.
    3. Table topper for enhancing taste.
    4. Essential ingredient for desserts.

---

## Positioning Strategy Steps
1. **Competitive Frame of Reference**:
   - Identify competitors.
   - Analyze their offerings and compare with your product.

2. **POP and POD Analysis**:
   - Define similarities (POP) to ensure consumer trust.
   - Highlight differences (POD) that make your product unique and desirable.

3. **Create a Perceptual Map**:
   - Use data to visualize how your product is perceived relative to competitors.
   - Identify gaps in the market that your product can fill.

4. **Evaluate Positioning Strategy**:
   - Ensure the proposed positioning is understandable, relevant, and sustainable.

# 3.2.2 Crafting an Impactful Positioning Statement

## Components of a Positioning Statement

### 1. **For Whom, For When, For Where**
- **Description of the Target Segment**:
  - Define who the product is intended for.
  - Specify the scenarios or contexts in which the product will be used.
  - Example: "For moms who want to preserve memories."

---

### 2. **What is the Value?**
- **Unique Value Proposition**:
  - Highlight the primary value or benefit the brand provides to the target audience.
  - Example: "Pickdeck is a simple cell phone feature that automatically transfers photos to your desktop."

---

### 3. **What and How?**
- **Evidence of the Value Proposition**:
  - Provide logical arguments, scientific data, testimonials, or other evidence to support the claims.
  - Show how the target segment can access and benefit from the value offered.
  - Example: "Pickdeck prevents photos from accumulating on your phone by seamlessly transferring them."

---

### 4. **Relative to Whom?**
- **Benchmark Against Competition**:
  - Explicitly describe the competitors or alternatives available in the market.
  - Establish a frame of reference for consumers to understand how the product is different.
  - Example: "Unlike traditional USB card, Bluetooth, or MMS services."

---

### 5. **Statement of Differentiation**
- **Why it Stands Out**:
  - Communicate why the product is unique or superior to competitors.
  - Example: "Voss offers the purest and most distinctive drinking experience because it derives from an artisan source in Southern Norway and is packaged in a stylish iconic glass bottle."

---

## Examples of Positioning Statements

### 1. **Pickdeck**:
- **Target**: "For moms who want to preserve memories."
- **Product/Service**: "Pickdeck is a simple cell phone feature."
- **Value**: "It automatically transfers photos to your desktop or laptop."
- **Competition**: "Unlike traditional USB card, Bluetooth, or MMS services."
- **Benefit**: "Your cell phone photos won’t accumulate for months."

# 3.2.3 Mastering Perceptual Mapping: A Guide to Strategic Positioning

## Overview
Positioning involves creating a clear, distinctive image of a product or service in the consumer's mind. Perceptual mapping is a powerful tool that helps marketers visually understand consumer preferences, evaluate brand attributes, and define competitive positioning.

---

## Steps in Positioning

### 1. **Collecting Preference Data**
- Conduct surveys to gather consumer preferences for different brands.
- Respondents rank brands on a scale (e.g., 1-10) based on their preferences.
- **Example**:
  - Brand preferences (e.g., Saab, G20, BMW, Ford).
  - Respondent scores (e.g., Audi = 8, Toyota = 3 for Respondent 1).

---

### 2. **Creating a Preference Map**
- Plot consumer preferences for various brands.
- **Visualization**:
  - Blue squares represent **consumers**.
  - Red dots represent **brands**.
- **Insights**:
  - Brands with clusters of consumers around them are preferred.
  - Brands with fewer consumers around them are less preferred.

---

### 3. **Collecting Perceptual Data**
- Conduct surveys to gather consumer perceptions of brands based on attributes.
- Attributes include factors like "attractive," "roomy," "prestige," "unreliable," etc.
- Respondents rate brands on each attribute using a scale (e.g., 1-10).
- **Example**:
  - G20 rated **5.6** for "attractive," **6.3** for "quiet."
  - Ford rated **4** for "attractive," **3.2** for "quiet."

---

### 4. **Creating a Perceptual Map**
- Plot the brands based on their association with attributes.
- **Visualization**:
  - Red dots represent **brands**.
  - Blue lines represent **attributes**.
- **Insights**:
  - Positive attributes (e.g., "prestige," "roomy," "quiet") cluster around top brands like BMW, Audi, Toyota.
  - Negative attributes (e.g., "unreliable," "poorly built") cluster around less preferred brands like Ford, Mercury.

---

### 5. **Combining Preference and Perception**
- Overlay consumer preferences, brand positions, and attributes on a single map.
- **Visualization**:
  - Red dots = **Brands**.
  - Blue lines = **Attributes**.
  - Pink lines = **Consumers**.
- **Insights**:
  - Consumers gravitate toward brands associated with positive attributes.
  - Brands with negative attributes attract fewer consumers.

---

## Interpreting Perceptual Maps

1. **Understanding Current Market Dynamics**:
   - Identify clusters of consumers and brands.
   - Recognize the attributes associated with preferred and less-preferred brands.

2. **Evaluating Market Opportunities**:
   - Identify unoccupied spaces on the map (attribute gaps).
   - Evaluate whether your product can fill a niche or differentiate itself effectively.

3. **POP (Point of Parity) and POD (Point of Difference)**:
   - Use the map to identify:
     - **POP**: Attributes shared with competitors to ensure legitimacy.
     - **POD**: Unique attributes to differentiate the product.

4. **Making Strategic Decisions**:
   - **POP Strategy**: Position your product as equivalent to a strong brand but with a price or value advantage.
   - **POD Strategy**: Focus on attributes not occupied by competitors (e.g., "easy service" if unaddressed).

---

## Example Analysis

### Scenario 1: New Brand in a Competitive Market
- **Map Insight**: Most customers and positive attributes are clustered around brands like BMW and Audi.
- **Strategy**: Focus on POD such as "easy service," an unoccupied attribute on the map.

### Scenario 2: New Brand in an Underserved Market
- **Map Insight**: Top brands occupy only 20% of the market, leaving room for new entrants.
- **Strategy**: Use POP to align with established brands but offer a competitive edge, such as lower price or additional features.
