# 6.2.1 Product Line Management

Product Line Management involves organizing, analyzing, and strategizing around a company's total portfolio of products. This practice is particularly crucial for companies with a wide array of offerings, such as Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, or FMCG companies like Dabur, Himalaya, and Patanjali. The goal is to manage the product portfolio effectively—deciding which products to retain, innovate, or phase out. Here's a structured explanation of the core concepts:

## Key Concepts in Product Line Management

### 1. **Product Item**
A **product item** refers to an individual SKU (Stock Keeping Unit). Examples:
- A table lamp.
- A bar of soap.
- A toothpaste tube.

Each distinct variation of a product is considered a product item.

---

### 2. **Product Line**
A **product line** is a group of related products offered by a company. These products usually share a common category or function. Examples:
- **Toothpaste Line:** Includes 10 varieties of toothpaste.
- **Lamp Line:** Includes 4 types: table lamps, ceiling lamps, track lamps, and desk lamps.

**Note:** A company may have multiple product lines, e.g., furniture, lamps, and tables for a home furnishing brand.

---

### 3. **Product Mix**
A **product mix** represents the total collection of product lines a company offers. It encompasses all product lines and their associated items.  
Example:
- **Lamps**: 4 types (table, ceiling, track, desk).
- **Tables**: 7 types (kitchen, dining, coffee, outdoor, etc.).
- **Chairs**: 5 types (dining room, living room, etc.).

**Product Mix = Total Product Lines and Items.**

### Characteristics of a Product Mix

#### a. **Length of a Product Line**
- **Definition**: The total number of items in a specific product line.
  - E.g., A lamp line with 4 types has a length of **4**.
  - A table line with 7 types has a length of **7**.

#### b. **Width/Breadth of a Product Mix**
- **Definition**: The total number of product lines in the product mix.
  - E.g., A company offering 3 product lines (lamps, tables, chairs) has a **width of 3**.

#### c. **Depth of a Product Line**
- **Definition**: The variety or number of variants available for each product item within a product line.
  - **Example (Table Lamps)**:
    - Variants: Circular, cylindrical, with lampshade, without lampshade, etc.
    - **Depth**: 4 variants.

  - **Example (Soap)**:
    - Sizes: 50g, 100g, 200g.
    - Aromas: Sandal, Lavender, Rose.
    - **Depth**: 3 (sizes) × 3 (aromas) = **9 variants**.
    - Adding gel and solid forms: **18 variants**.

#### d. **Consistency**
- **Definition**: The degree of relatedness between different product lines in terms of:
  - End-use.
  - Production requirements.
  - Distribution channels.

  **Examples**:
  - Soap and detergents: High consistency (similar distribution/logistics).
  - Soap and ice cream: Low consistency (different storage, logistics, and retail requirements).

---

## Why Length, Breadth, Depth, and Consistency Matter
1. **Resource Management**: Helps in allocating resources effectively across product lines.
2. **Market Segmentation**: Greater depth allows targeting micro-segments, while similar depth across lines targets broader segments.
3. **Cost Optimization**: Consistent product lines can share logistics and distribution channels.
4. **Strategic Focus**: Avoids spreading too thin across too many variants, ensuring focus and efficiency.

# 6.2.2 Product Line Strategies
Product Line Management involves determining the number and variety of product items to maintain in a company's portfolio. It emphasizes managing the **depth**, which is a critical factor contributing to the proliferation of product lines. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

## **Key Factors Influencing Product Line Depth**

1. **Customer Heterogeneity**:
   - When customer requirements vary significantly, the market divides into micro-segments. 
   - Example: In the shampoo category:
     - Anti-dandruff shampoos
     - Anti-hair fall shampoos
     - Shampoos for straight hair or black hair
     - Shampoos for split ends
   - This segmentation increases product line depth to cater to diverse needs.

2. **Manufacturer's Ability to Offer Customization**:
   - If the company has the technological and production capability to meet specific segment demands, the depth of the product line can increase.

3. **Competition**:
   - High competition drives companies to innovate and further segment the market.
   - Low competition may result in limited innovation or segmentation.

4. **Category Size**:
   - Companies assess if the market size and willingness to pay justify the effort of expanding the product line.
   - In price-sensitive markets, excessive segmentation may not yield returns.

5. **Company Objectives and Resources**:
   - Decisions depend on whether expanding the product line aligns with the company’s profitability and revenue goals.
   - Risk of **cannibalization**: New products within the same line might eat into the sales of existing products.

## **Product Line Analysis**

### **Purpose**
To determine the optimal size of the product mix. Companies evaluate:
1. **Performance**: Analyze sales, profit, and market trends.
2. **Competitor Profiling**: Compare your offerings with competitors to understand positioning and sales impact.
3. **Iterative Assessment**:
   - Add products if they increase market share and profits.
   - Drop products if they cannibalize sales or reduce profitability.

### **Key Considerations**
- An experienced brand manager must evaluate whether:
  - Adding new items increases revenue.
  - Reducing items improves profitability.

## **Product Line Strategies**

### 1. **Optimal Product Line Length**
   - **Too Short**: If adding items increases profits, the product line needs expansion.
   - **Too Long**: If dropping items increases profits, the product line needs pruning.

### 2. **Line Stretching**
   Expanding the product line beyond its current range, either upward or downward.
   - **Upward Stretching**: Target higher-end customers with premium offerings.
     - Example: A soap brand priced at ₹20 introduces a luxury variant at ₹50.
     - Example: Titan introducing designer watches at ₹50,000 or more.
   - **Downward Stretching**: Target budget-conscious customers.
     - Example: A luxury perfume brand introducing affordable deodorants for ₹500.
     - Example: A watch brand offering children's watches at ₹500.

### 3. **Line Filling**
   Adding more items within the existing price range to cover market gaps and compete effectively.
   - Example: Car manufacturers offering multiple models in the same price range with variations (engine power, automatic/manual transmission, colors).
   - Objective: Increase profits, meet customer needs, and fend off competitors.
   - **Risk**: Cannibalization, where one product eats into the market of another.

### 4. **Line Modernization**
   Revamping existing products in terms of:
   - **Style, design, or technology**.
   - Example: Maruti introducing **Nexa** for high-end cars.
   - Example: Hero Splendor with models like Splendor Plus, Splendor Pro, and Splendor Classic.

### 5. **Line Featuring**
   Highlighting specific products as showpieces to attract customers to the entire product line.
   - Example: Apple advertising its iPhone Pro Max models as aspirational products to drive interest in its other models.
   - Example: Jewelry brands showcasing heavy designer items in advertisements.

### 6. **Line Pruning**
   Eliminating unprofitable or underperforming items from the product line.
   - Indicators: Declining sales, negative feedback, and lack of market interest.
   - Objective: Focus resources on profitable items and reduce inefficiencies.
