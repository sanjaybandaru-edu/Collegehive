- **Example**: Targeting youth, women, teenagers, or professionals in a certain field like doctors or engineers.
  
## 2. Mass Market

- **Example**: Products like milk or bread, which are meant for general consumption without catering to a particular segment.

## 3. Marketing Mix
- **Definition**: A set of factors controlled by a company to influence consumers’ purchasing decisions. It’s foundational to developing marketing strategies.
- **Origin**: Coined by Professor Neil Borden in 1964, and later expanded to include the 4Ps by Professor Jerome McCarthy in 1960.
- **4Ps of Marketing**:
  - **Product**: What you’re selling.
  - **Price**: How much the product costs.
  - **Place**: Distribution channels used to sell the product.
  - **Promotion**: Marketing communication strategies used to reach the target market.

## 4. Additional P's in Marketing
- Over time, the 4Ps have been expanded, especially with the rise of digital and service industries.

### 5Ps

### 7Ps

## 5. Business Market vs. Consumer Market
