### A New Era in Coca-Cola’s Management
In 1981, **Roberto Goizueta** assumed the role of chairman, with **Donald Keough** as president. This leadership marked a transformative era, diverging from Coca-Cola’s traditional values. Goizueta challenged Coca-Cola’s long-standing adherence to its formula and brand culture, focusing instead on profitability and strategic innovation.

### Goizueta’s Philosophy

## 4. Market Position and Competitive Pressures

### Decline in Market Share
Despite these efforts, Coca-Cola continued to face challenges:
- By 1984, Coca-Cola’s **market share declined by 1%**, while Pepsi gained 1.5%.
- The gap in U.S. market share between Coca-Cola and Pepsi narrowed to **2.9%** overall, with Coca-Cola’s lead in-store market share trailing by **1.7 percentage points**.

### Fragmented Market Demand
Coca-Cola’s decline in market share signaled a shifting consumer landscape, with demands diverging across age groups and lifestyle preferences. While Coca-Cola remained popular among older, loyal consumers, Pepsi’s appeal to younger, trend-focused customers left Coca-Cola vulnerable in key demographics.
