# 1.7.4 The decline of Coca Cola

## Introduction
As Coca-Cola grew to become one of the most recognized brands globally, the company began to face a series of challenges in the 1970s and 1980s. These issues included legal troubles, internal conflicts, failed diversification attempts, and fierce competition from Pepsi. This section delves into these challenges and their implications for Coca-Cola's future growth.

---

## 1. Legal Troubles

### Competitive Practices
- Coca-Cola encountered **legal issues** due to complaints regarding **restrictive practices** among its bottlers.
- Bottlers were required to sell only Coca-Cola products and were restricted from bottling competitor brands like Pepsi. This exclusivity led to legal scrutiny and complaints regarding anti-competitive behavior.
- Top executives found themselves focusing more on resolving these legal problems rather than steering the company toward future growth and innovation.

---

## 2. Internal Struggles

### Rapid Growth and Administration Issues
- The rapid expansion of Coca-Cola created **administrative and control challenges**. The company grew too quickly, leading to difficulties in managing operations effectively.
- Conflicts arose among bottlers regarding pricing, with some agreeing to price increases while others resisted, forcing the company to mediate these disputes.
- There was also a struggle to maintain control over the **franchisee model**, as many third-generation franchisees were reportedly not investing enough into their Coca-Cola businesses.

### Understanding the Franchisee Model
- The **franchisee model** involves a franchisor (e.g., Coca-Cola) providing a brand name, products, and business support to franchisees who invest in infrastructure and resources.
- Franchisees benefit from an established customer base and operational support, but Coca-Cola struggled with franchisees who were not fully committed to the brand, undermining its market position.

---

## 3. Failed Diversification Attempts

### Diversification Efforts
- Coca-Cola attempted to diversify its business by venturing into non-core areas, such as water treatment equipment, plastic bags, and wine. These ventures included:
  - **Aqua Chem**: Water treatment equipment and boilers.
  - **Presto Products**: Manufacturer of plastic bags.
  - **Wine Spectrum**: Owner of Taylor California wines.
- However, these diversification efforts did not yield the expected results, as they were far removed from Coca-Cola's core business of beverages.

### The Need for Growth
- The company's leadership believed that diversification was essential to hedge against market risks and achieve sustained growth. Yet, the attempts to expand into unrelated sectors strained resources and diluted focus on the core beverage business.

---

## 4. Market Competition and Share Decline

### Increased Competition from Pepsi
- By the early 1980s, Coca-Cola's growth rate had slowed to **1-2%**, significantly lower than the historical average of **15%**.
- The compounded return on investment (ROI) dropped to just **1%**, indicating declining financial performance.
- Coca-Cola faced stiff competition from Pepsi, which claimed **29.3% market share** compared to Coca-Cola's **29%** for the first time in history in one of the distribution channels.

### Internal Management Issues
- Internal management issues compounded Coca-Cola's struggles, as the board of directors faced fragmentation with multiple vice presidents, many of whom were nearing retirement age, averaging around **70 years**.
- The company's traditional strength in fountain sales began to falter, leading to losses in that segment.

# 1.7.7 The Rivalry - Coca Cola's downfall

## 1. Introduction
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Pepsi launched strategic campaigns that capitalized on cultural shifts and demographic changes in the United States. Against the backdrop of a post-Vietnam, post-Watergate U.S., and a recovering economy, Pepsi’s campaigns emphasized youthful rebellion, differentiating itself from Coca-Cola’s established, traditional image. This document explores Pepsi's notable campaigns, including its association with Michael Jackson and the "Pepsi Challenge," highlighting the impacts on Coca-Cola and the soft drink market.

---

## 2. The Pepsi Generation: Leveraging Celebrity Endorsement with Michael Jackson

### Cultural Context and Branding
In the late 1970s, Pepsi chose to align itself with the emerging youth culture by associating with a modern icon, Michael Jackson, often referred to as the "King of Pop." Pepsi’s branding appealed to a younger demographic, contrasting with Coca-Cola's image, which resonated with an older generation.

### Michael Jackson as Brand Ambassador
- **Influence and Appeal**: Michael Jackson, a revolutionary performer, captured the youthful energy and rebellious spirit Pepsi wanted to project. In today’s terms, Jackson would be considered an “influencer”; at the time, he was a brand ambassador who personified the spirit of the "Pepsi Generation."
- **Cultural Shift**: This campaign differentiated Pepsi from its competitors, particularly Coca-Cola, by associating Pepsi with a new, modern, and energetic music style that spoke to a generation looking for change and individuality.

---

## 3. The Pepsi Challenge: Product Testing and Market Disruption

### Origins and Execution
In the mid-1970s, Pepsi launched the **Pepsi Challenge** in Texas to address its small market share compared to Coca-Cola. This campaign leveraged in-store promotions at 7-Eleven convenience stores, a major Pepsi distributor, to test consumer preferences in a controlled setting.

### Blind Taste Test
The Pepsi Challenge involved offering consumers two unmarked bottles of cola and asking them to choose their preferred taste. In these blind tests, **Pepsi consistently scored higher**, with 52% of consumers preferring Pepsi over Coca-Cola. This campaign highlighted Pepsi's taste as superior, leading to a substantial increase in market share from 6% to 14%.

### Impact on Coca-Cola
- **Consumer Perception**: The hidden-camera recordings of consumers preferring Pepsi over Coca-Cola served as compelling advertising content, positioning Pepsi as the superior-tasting cola.
- **Market Response**: Coca-Cola challenged Pepsi’s campaign, claiming it was misleading, only to discover through its own tests that **Pepsi’s taste appeal in blind tests was accurate**. Coca-Cola’s position as a leader in taste superiority was questioned.

---

## 4. Market Dynamics and Consumer Demographics

### The Decline in Soft Drink Consumption
During the 1970s and 1980s, industry experts noted a decline in carbonated soft drink sales, partly due to changing demographics:
- **Aging Coca-Cola Consumers**: Coca-Cola’s core consumer base consisted of older individuals, many of whom were now experiencing health issues that restricted their soda consumption. Health concerns such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity limited their ability to consume sugary carbonated beverages.
- **Pepsi’s Youth-Oriented Demographic**: Pepsi’s younger consumer base could consume more, aligning with the lifestyle of an active, vibrant youth. This demographic advantage allowed Pepsi to maintain and grow its market share as Coca-Cola’s aging customers reduced their intake.

### Market Share Shift
- By 1982, **Pepsi’s market share grew, surpassing Coca-Cola** in certain areas, including supermarkets, where Coca-Cola had traditionally held a strong position. An AC Nielsen report indicated Pepsi was gaining traction in supermarkets, accounting for about one-third of Coca-Cola’s market volume.
- **Loyalty Decline for Coca-Cola**: Coca-Cola’s hardcore customer base dropped from 18% in 1972 to 12% by 1982. Meanwhile, Pepsi’s loyal customer base grew from 4% to 11% during the same period, illustrating Pepsi's appeal among younger consumers who could consume more of the product.

## 5. Coca-Cola’s Challenge and Strategic Options

As Pepsi’s market share increased, Coca-Cola faced a unique conundrum:
- **Legacy and Tradition**: Coca-Cola’s brand relied heavily on tradition and the “sacred” nature of its original formula, created by John Pemberton. Coca-Cola had never extensively tested its formula against competitors, assuming it held a universal appeal.
- **Competitive Blind Spot**: The Pepsi Challenge exposed Coca-Cola’s overconfidence in its legacy formula. Pepsi’s success with the blind taste test highlighted the need for Coca-Cola to reconsider its formula and its marketing strategies to compete effectively with Pepsi.

### Strategic Dilemma
With an aging consumer base, an industry slowdown, and Pepsi’s growing appeal among younger audiences, Coca-Cola needed to respond with a strategic shift that could appeal to younger consumers without alienating its loyal base.

### Potential Strategic Approaches for Coca-Cola
1. **Product Innovation**: Adjusting Coca-Cola’s formula slightly to appeal to a broader audience, including younger consumers.
2. **Marketing Repositioning**: Crafting campaigns that emphasize the refreshing and youthful aspects of Coca-Cola to counter Pepsi’s appeal among younger consumers.
3. **Health-Oriented Branding**: Exploring low-sugar or healthier versions of Coca-Cola to appeal to health-conscious consumers, thus expanding its consumer base and catering to evolving market preferences.

## 6. Conclusion: Lessons from the Pepsi Challenge

Pepsi’s strategic moves in the 1970s and 1980s, including celebrity endorsements, taste tests, and a strong youth-focused branding approach, provided significant competitive advantages. By questioning Coca-Cola’s assumed market superiority, Pepsi carved out a space in the cola market and attracted a younger, loyal consumer base. Coca-Cola’s response required a careful balance between innovation and tradition, reflecting the challenge of adapting to changing market dynamics and consumer preferences without losing brand identity.

The Pepsi Challenge serves as a pivotal case in marketing strategy, highlighting the power of understanding consumer preferences, leveraging generational shifts, and using experiential marketing to build brand loyalty.

## 3. Key Influences in Coca-Cola’s Competitive Landscape (5Cs Analysis)

1. **Company**: Coca-Cola faced challenges as its board members aged, and the brand maintained a traditional image that younger audiences found less appealing. This aging leadership initially clung to Coca-Cola’s heritage, while the market was shifting towards a more dynamic, rebellious image presented by Pepsi.

2. **Customers**: The customer demographics of Coca-Cola and Pepsi differed significantly. Although both targeted youth, the **values and attitudes of young people in the 1960s-80s evolved**:
   - **Coca-Cola’s customer base** included older and loyal consumers, focused on a classic taste experience.
   - **Pepsi’s customer base** consisted of a younger, more rebellious audience, seeking an identity distinct from older generations.

3. **Competition**: Pepsi’s **Pepsi Challenge** (blind taste test campaigns) challenged Coca-Cola’s longstanding taste superiority, positioning Pepsi as a youthful, dynamic alternative. This approach resonated with younger audiences, positioning Pepsi as the “Pepsi Generation” and creating a **rebel identity** that clashed with Coca-Cola’s traditional image.

4. **Collaborators**: Pepsi’s partnerships with distribution channels (e.g., 7-Eleven) increased its reach, especially in supermarkets where Coca-Cola struggled to compete effectively. These collaborations gave Pepsi better visibility and customer access.

5. **Context**: Economic and social conditions influenced consumer preferences. As the U.S. population aged, health concerns over sugar intake and carbonation led to lower consumption among Coca-Cola’s primary audience. Meanwhile, younger demographics preferred Pepsi for its modern, spirited positioning.

## 5. Strategic Challenges and Potential Solutions

### Coca-Cola’s Diminishing Market Lead
By 1984, Coca-Cola’s lead in the U.S. market had shrunk as Pepsi gained popularity. Coca-Cola’s aging customer base and the rise in health consciousness among older consumers led to decreasing cola consumption. Simultaneously, Pepsi’s rebellious image drew younger consumers away from Coca-Cola.

1. **Revisiting the Core Product**: Conduct taste tests to validate Coca-Cola’s superiority in taste and consider slight tweaks for broader appeal.
2. **Targeted Brand Positioning**: Emphasize Coca-Cola’s unique value, perhaps by blending traditional values with modern influences to attract younger audiences.
3. **Enhanced Marketing Campaigns**: Utilize digital channels to reach younger consumers, emphasizing Coca-Cola’s versatility across different lifestyles.
4. **Health-Conscious Product Development**: Offer alternative, health-conscious beverage options to capture the aging market segment, such as low-calorie or low-sugar variants.
