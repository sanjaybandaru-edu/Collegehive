# 5.5.1 Buying Benefits and Strategies in Business Markets

## Four Types of Benefits in B2B Business

### 1. **Tangible Financial Benefits**
   - **Definition**: Values that the seller can communicate and the buyer can verify readily.
   - **Examples**:
     - Horsepower in engines.
     - Processing speed in computers.
     - Fuel efficiency in machinery.
   - **Key Feature**: These benefits are measurable and verifiable, making it easier for buyers to understand their value proposition.

### 2. **Non-Tangible Financial Benefits**
   - **Definition**: Values that the seller conveys but are not easily validated by the buyer.
   - **Examples**:
     - Revenue increase through improved CRM software.
     - Enhanced profitability using advanced hardware.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Buyers don’t typically calculate the financial implications of these benefits.
     - Sellers must **tangibilize the intangible** by:
       - Showing clear paths to benefits (e.g., increased repeat orders due to big data analytics).
       - Providing third-party reports or case studies demonstrating success.
       - Offering performance-based payment models (e.g., leasing, pay-per-use).
   - **Objective**: Make the intangible benefits concrete by demonstrating their potential impact on the customer’s business.

### 3. **Tangible Non-Financial Benefits**
   - **Definition**: Values that are difficult for the seller to quantify but are appreciable by the buyer.
   - **Examples**:
     - Ease of use of a familiar operating system.
     - Reputation of the supplier.
     - International sourcing ensuring uninterrupted supply chains.
   - **Importance**:
     - Buyers often reward these benefits with price premiums or preferred vendor status.
     - Although not directly tied to financial metrics, these benefits enhance the trust and reliability perceived by the buyer.

### 4. **Non-Tangible Non-Financial Benefits**
   - **Definition**: Values that neither the buyer nor the seller can easily quantify in monetary terms.
   - **Examples**:
     - Vendors exceeding contractual obligations, such as offering 24/7 maintenance.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Buyers may not prioritize these benefits without clear proof of their value.
     - Sellers must tangibilize these benefits by:
       - Presenting past breakdowns and associated losses to justify the value of round-the-clock maintenance.
       - Highlighting potential savings or business continuity benefits.

## Importance of Benefits in Strategy Development

### 1. **Quantifying Benefits**
   - Regardless of the type of benefit, it must be represented in measurable terms:
     - Reducing costs.
     - Increasing revenue.
     - Avoiding losses.
   - Sellers should clearly demonstrate how their offering aligns with the customer’s performance metrics.

### 2. **Role of Salesmanship**
   - **Key Tool**: Personal selling is the cornerstone of B2B marketing.
   - **Process**:
     - Providing detailed presentations and demonstrations.
     - Engaging in multiple rounds of negotiations.
     - Building long-term relationships with the customer.

### 3. **Government and Tender Processes**
   - **Typical Process**:
     1. Advertisement of tender.
     2. Submission of technical and financial bids.
     3. Evaluation of technical qualifications.
     4. Selection based on the lowest financial bid (L1).
   - **Significance**: Sellers must meet both technical and financial criteria to secure contracts.

## Strategy Implications
   - A clear understanding of benefits allows sellers to:
     - **Convince customers** by demonstrating how offerings solve specific problems.
     - **Tailor value propositions** to address tangible and intangible needs.
   - Tangibilizing benefits and providing measurable outcomes ensures trust and facilitates decision-making.
   - Personal interaction and sales engagement play a pivotal role in delivering and reinforcing the perceived value of these benefits.
