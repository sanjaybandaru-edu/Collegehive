# 6.4.6 Market Decline Phase

The **Decline Stage** represents the final phase of the product life cycle where sales and profits begin to decrease. This decline can occur slowly or rapidly, depending on various market factors. Ultimately, the product faces obsolescence due to technological advancements, changing customer preferences, increased competition, and overcapacity within the industry.

## Key Characteristics of the Decline Stage

### 1. **Declining Sales**:
   - Sales of most products or brands in this phase begin to decline.
   - The decline can be gradual or sudden, depending on factors such as market saturation, technological advances, and consumer shifts.
   
### 2. **Technology Obsolescence**:
   - **Technological advancements** make older products outdated, leading to reduced demand.
   - New innovations can render previous models or versions of products less relevant.

### 3. **Change in Customer Preferences**:
   - Consumer preferences shift towards newer or more innovative products, contributing to the decline of older ones.
   
### 4. **Increased Competition**:
   - The entry of new competitors, or the growing offerings from existing companies, exacerbates the decline, especially if the product is no longer a market leader.
   
### 5. **Overcapacity in the Industry**:
   - Overcapacity occurs when the market becomes flooded with too many similar products, resulting in a **price war** as companies struggle to maintain their market share. This reduces overall profitability.

   - **High Exit Barriers and Low Entry Barriers**: Companies often find it hard to exit the market even if they no longer see profitability due to high exit barriers, leading to continued competition, even in a declining market.

## Factors Contributing to Decline

- **Price Wars**: Intense price cutting and frequent promotions to attract remaining customers.
- **Profit Reduction**: As competition increases and demand shrinks, profit margins also decrease.
- **Market Withdrawal**: Companies begin withdrawing from unprofitable segments, be it geographic, demographic, or product-specific, focusing only on core areas.
- **Reduced Offerings**: Companies reduce their product range and only offer the most basic, core products to maintain relevance.

## Strategic Decisions in the Decline Stage

The primary decision at this stage is **how long to stay in the market** and when to exit. Companies must evaluate whether they can turn the market around, enter a new segment, or introduce a new product to begin a new life cycle. The following strategies can help navigate the decline stage:

### 1. **Increase Investment**:
   - **Strategy**: Increase the firmâ€™s investment if there is potential for future growth, such as through research and development (R&D) for new technologies or products.
   - **Objective**: Keep the market "warm" for the future, possibly capitalizing on future opportunities like a new product launch.
   - **Example**: A company continues investing in a declining product while working on a new, innovative version to revitalize the brand.

### 2. **Maintain Investment**:
   - **Strategy**: Continue to invest in the declining product but adopt a "wait and watch" approach.
   - **Objective**: Observe the market for signs of a potential rebound or future opportunities before deciding to exit completely.
   - **Example**: A company keeps its product in the market but does not push for major new investments, maintaining its position until further market signals are clear.

### 3. **Selective Investment Reduction**:
   - **Strategy**: Gradually reduce investments, focusing only on the most profitable or relevant market segments.
   - **Objective**: Cut costs and minimize losses while withdrawing from less profitable markets.
   - **Example**: A brand stops offering discounts or promotions in non-core geographic areas but continues in select profitable markets.

### 4. **Harvesting**:
   - **Strategy**: Gradually reduce resources allocated to the product, aiming to "milk" as much profit as possible before the product completely declines.
   - **Objective**: Allow the product to "die a slow death" by withdrawing investments, reducing promotions, and minimizing product offerings.
   - **Example**: A company reduces the product's marketing efforts and limits its distribution channels, extracting any remaining value while accepting a decline in sales.

### 5. **Divesting**:
   - **Strategy**: Sell the product or brand to a competitor or another entity interested in entering the market or revitalizing the product.
   - **Objective**: Exit the market while extracting value by selling the brand or product to another company.
   - **Example**: A company sells off a declining product line to a competitor who believes they can turn it around or gain value from it.
