# 6.5.2 Evolution of Services

## Traditional Retail Model

### The Old Way: Kirana Stores

20 years ago, retail was predominantly conducted through **Kirana stores** or **mom-and-pop stores**. Customers would visit these stores with a **list of items** they needed. The shopkeeper would then:
- Select the items
- Weigh and pack them
- Prepare a bill

This process was labor-intensive, with a strong **service element**, as customers relied on the shopkeeper to handle all the aspects of shopping.

## Evolution of Retail Services

### Home Delivery Service

As time went on, the retail experience started evolving. A new type of shopkeeper introduced the concept of **home delivery**. Instead of customers visiting the store:
- They could simply send a list to the shopkeeper, often through a call or a message (such as **WhatsApp**).
- The shopkeeper would deliver the items to the customer’s home, adding a layer of convenience and service.

### Credit Service in Small Retail Stores

Even small retail businesses like **tea stalls**, **vegetable vendors**, and **street food sellers** in India began offering **credit** or **Khata**:
- Customers could purchase items on credit throughout the month.
- At the end of the month or the beginning of the next, the total amount would be calculated, and the customer would clear the bill.

## Online Retail: Expanding Service Offerings

With the advent of **online retail platforms** such as **Amazon**, **Flipkart**, and **BigBasket**, the concept of service further evolved. Customers now had access to:
- **A much larger variety of products**.
- The ability to apply **filters** (e.g., brand, price, customer feedback) to narrow down their choices.

## Quick Commerce: The New Era of Service

In **metro cities**, a new retail trend emerged: **quick commerce**. This took the service concept to the next level:
- Instead of a scheduled delivery window, **orders were fulfilled within minutes** (typically 10 minutes).
- Customers could receive their products quickly, enhancing convenience and immediacy.

## Retailer’s Dilemma: Variety vs. Speed

Retailers face a decision:
- Should they focus on providing a **large variety** of products, which would typically be available in large retail formats?
- Or should they differentiate by offering **fast delivery** (i.e., **quick commerce**) to meet customer demand for speed?
