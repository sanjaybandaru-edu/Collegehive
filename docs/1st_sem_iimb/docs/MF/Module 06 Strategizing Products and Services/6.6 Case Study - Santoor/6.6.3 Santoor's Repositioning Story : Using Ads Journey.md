# 6.6.3 Santoor's Repositioning Story : Using Ads Journey

The challenge for any advertising agency is not only to create a strong product but also to communicate its value to the consumer. The positioning of a brand is the key to achieving this communication and creating a lasting image in the mind of the consumer. Let's explore how Santoor Soap has evolved its positioning over time.

## What is Positioning?
Positioning refers to creating a distinct image of a brand in the mind of the consumer. It's about how the brand is perceived relative to other brands and the values it communicates. 

## The Early Campaigns: Establishing the Core Positioning
Initially, Santoor's campaign targeted traditional values, focusing on the image of a "younger looking woman." The classic approach used a **"mistaken identity"** scenario, where a married woman with children was mistaken for a younger, unmarried woman. This message was reinforced by showcasing **ingredients like sandalwood and turmeric** and emphasizing the **benefits of youthful skin**.

### Example 1: Family Function
In one of the campaigns, during a family function, two elderly women observe a young-looking woman. They comment on her beauty, thinking she is unmarried. When the woman runs in and introduces herself as a mother, they are surprised by how youthful she looks. The brand emphasized how Santoor soap helped maintain youthful skin.

### Example 2: Village Fair
Another commercial featured a rural fair where a woman buying bangles is mistaken for a young unmarried girl by an older vendor. Again, the surprise comes when the woman reveals she has a child, and the ad reinforces the message of youthful skin.

These campaigns all conveyed the **same core message**: that the Santoor woman is youthful, with the help of its ingredients—sandalwood and turmeric.

## Evolving the Campaigns: Expanding to Modernity
As the brand grew, its target segment evolved to include women who are not only traditional but also modern in their outlook. This shift was reflected in the campaign's setting and tone.

### Example 3: Bookstore Setting
The tone of the campaign changed when Santoor introduced a modern setting—a bookstore. In this ad, a group of college girls mistakes an older woman for their peer. The ad’s modern and progressive tone suggested that the brand was no longer just about traditional values but also about **personal development** and a **modern outlook**.

### Example 4: Aerobics and Fitness
As the campaign matured, Santoor moved into the realm of personal health and fitness. In one ad, a woman is shown participating in an aerobics class, highlighting the importance of self-care and maintaining youthfulness. Here, the product was not just for the family but focused on **individual empowerment** and health.

### Key Changes:
- The product’s packaging dropped the “new” label, reflecting its established place in the market.
- The communication shifted from a woman stating she looked young to others noticing her youthfulness, signaling **market acceptance**.
- The target segment expanded to include modern, independent women balancing **multiple roles**—traditional and contemporary.

## Repositioning: The Growth Phase
Santoor’s messaging transitioned from being purely functional (youthful skin) to also being **social and experiential**. The product’s value proposition was repositioned, reaching a broader audience of modern, confident women. 

### Outcome:
- Santoor achieved **5000 tons per annum** within 18 months of these changes.
- The brand retained its popularity, while competitors like **Swastik** faded, showing the effectiveness of the campaign.

## Celebrity Endorsement and Expanding the Persona
The brand continued to evolve its image, bringing in celebrity endorsements and focusing on **empowerment**. Now, women in the Santoor ads were shown as **career-oriented**, breaking through traditional barriers.

### Example 5: Using Celebrities
Madhavan featured in an ad that highlighted a woman’s **unconventional career choice**, such as a choreographer. Santoor portrayed modern women who were succeeding in **non-traditional careers**. This empowered message appealed to a more **modern, career-driven audience**.

The use of **celebrity endorsements** allowed the brand to maintain relevance and appeal to contemporary consumers.

## Addressing Social Causes and Shifting Gears
In later campaigns, the brand began to address social causes, like encouraging children to play physical games rather than spending time on mobile phones. A mother is shown taking an active role in making her children play outdoors. 

This shift showed the **evolving role of mothers**—not only as caregivers but as active participants in their children's lives, helping them lead a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

### Key Insights:
- **Santoor’s message** now focused on a modern mother balancing family care and youthful energy.
- The **product positioning** remained the same, but the context in which it was presented had evolved.
- Santoor had successfully expanded into multiple consumer segments, reinforcing its core brand message.

## Transition to Premium Segment: Luxury and Innovation
By now, Santoor had successfully transitioned into the **maturity stage** of the product life cycle. It began introducing premium variants with ingredients like **honey and apricot**, aiming for the **luxury market**.

### Example 6: The Premium Shift
In one ad, the product targets **modern, young men** who find the Santoor woman appealing. The mistaken identity theme persists, but now the woman is positioned as someone who can appeal to a more **luxurious, sophisticated audience**.

- The new **luxury packaging** and **premium ingredients** helped Santoor resegment the market, targeting a more **affluent consumer base**.

### Product Line Extension:
Santoor extended its product range by adding **honey and apricot** soaps, moving away from its original sandalwood and turmeric focus. This was a clear indication that the brand was now aiming to be a **quality leader** in the **premium market**.
