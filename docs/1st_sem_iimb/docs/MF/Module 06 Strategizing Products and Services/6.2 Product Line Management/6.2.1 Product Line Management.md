# 6.2.1 Product Line Management

Product Line Management involves organizing, analyzing, and strategizing around a company's total portfolio of products. This practice is particularly crucial for companies with a wide array of offerings, such as Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, or FMCG companies like Dabur, Himalaya, and Patanjali. The goal is to manage the product portfolio effectively—deciding which products to retain, innovate, or phase out. Here's a structured explanation of the core concepts:

## Key Concepts in Product Line Management

### 1. **Product Item**
A **product item** refers to an individual SKU (Stock Keeping Unit). Examples:
- A table lamp.
- A bar of soap.
- A toothpaste tube.

Each distinct variation of a product is considered a product item.

### 2. **Product Line**
A **product line** is a group of related products offered by a company. These products usually share a common category or function. Examples:
- **Toothpaste Line:** Includes 10 varieties of toothpaste.
- **Lamp Line:** Includes 4 types: table lamps, ceiling lamps, track lamps, and desk lamps.

**Note:** A company may have multiple product lines, e.g., furniture, lamps, and tables for a home furnishing brand.

### 3. **Product Mix**
A **product mix** represents the total collection of product lines a company offers. It encompasses all product lines and their associated items.  
Example:
- **Lamps**: 4 types (table, ceiling, track, desk).
- **Tables**: 7 types (kitchen, dining, coffee, outdoor, etc.).
- **Chairs**: 5 types (dining room, living room, etc.).

**Product Mix = Total Product Lines and Items.**

### Characteristics of a Product Mix

#### a. **Length of a Product Line**
- **Definition**: The total number of items in a specific product line.
  - E.g., A lamp line with 4 types has a length of **4**.
  - A table line with 7 types has a length of **7**.

#### b. **Width/Breadth of a Product Mix**
- **Definition**: The total number of product lines in the product mix.
  - E.g., A company offering 3 product lines (lamps, tables, chairs) has a **width of 3**.

#### c. **Depth of a Product Line**
- **Definition**: The variety or number of variants available for each product item within a product line.
  - **Example (Table Lamps)**:
    - Variants: Circular, cylindrical, with lampshade, without lampshade, etc.
    - **Depth**: 4 variants.

  - **Example (Soap)**:
    - Sizes: 50g, 100g, 200g.
    - Aromas: Sandal, Lavender, Rose.
    - **Depth**: 3 (sizes) × 3 (aromas) = **9 variants**.
    - Adding gel and solid forms: **18 variants**.

#### d. **Consistency**
- **Definition**: The degree of relatedness between different product lines in terms of:
  - End-use.
  - Production requirements.
  - Distribution channels.

  **Examples**:
  - Soap and detergents: High consistency (similar distribution/logistics).
  - Soap and ice cream: Low consistency (different storage, logistics, and retail requirements).

## Why Length, Breadth, Depth, and Consistency Matter
1. **Resource Management**: Helps in allocating resources effectively across product lines.
2. **Market Segmentation**: Greater depth allows targeting micro-segments, while similar depth across lines targets broader segments.
3. **Cost Optimization**: Consistent product lines can share logistics and distribution channels.
4. **Strategic Focus**: Avoids spreading too thin across too many variants, ensuring focus and efficiency.
