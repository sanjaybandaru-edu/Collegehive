# 2.1.2 Examples of Random Variables

## Example 1: Sales Calls
- **Situation:** Making sales calls to five customers, where each outcome (placing an order) is random.
- **Random Variable:** Number of orders received from five calls.
- **Values:** Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- **Type:** Discrete Random Variable.

## Example 2: Defective Radios
- **Situation:** Receiving a shipment of 50 radios from a supplier, some of which may be defective.
- **Random Variable:** Number of defective radios in the shipment.
- **Values:** Ranges from 0 to 50.
- **Type:** Discrete Random Variable.

## Example 3: Restaurant Customers
- **Situation:** Counting the number of customers coming to a restaurant on any given day.
- **Random Variable:** Number of customers per day.
- **Values:** Can technically range up to infinity.
- **Type:** Discrete Random Variable.

## Example 4: Time Between Bank Customers
- **Situation:** Observing the time between arrivals of consecutive customers at a bank.
- **Random Variable:** Time between arrivals.
- **Values:** Any positive number (time in minutes or seconds).
- **Type:** Continuous Random Variable.

## Example 5: Soft Drink Can Volume
- **Situation:** A soft drink can is marked to contain 12 ounces of fluid.
- **Random Variable:** Actual amount of fluid in the can.
- **Values:** Could vary between 11.5 to 12.5 fluid ounces.
- **Type:** Continuous Random Variable.

## Example 6: Chemical Reaction Temperature
- **Situation:** A chemical process where a reaction is desired at a certain temperature.
- **Random Variable:** Temperature at which the reaction takes place.
- **Values:** Between 100 degrees centigrade and 150 degrees centigrade.
- **Type:** Continuous Random Variable.

## Key Concepts
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** For discrete random variables, denotes the probability of taking a specific value.
- **Examples in Plots:**
  - For a fair die, PMF is uniform (1/6 for each side).
  - For a biased die, PMF varies by the probability of each side.
