# 2.2.1 Linear Combinations of Random Variables 

## Definition
**Linear Combination:** A linear combination of random variables is an expression formed by taking the sum of multiple random variables, each multiplied by a constant coefficient.

**General Form:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20292a9a-571f-403a-ad72-0148748849ea)

Where Y is the new random variable, ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf008c0-680a-4429-9241-13e5caeef296)
 are the original random variables, and ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dfa87a7-7b46-4854-b2d2-13cf3a470cb0)
 are the coefficients.

## Examples

### Example 1: Investment Portfolio
- **Situation:** An investor allocates funds across different assets, with each asset's return being a random variable.
- **Random Variables:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2135b321-4128-4279-8e9f-7befc5d6fb79)
 representing the returns on three different assets.
- **Linear Combination:** The total return, R, on the portfolio could be expressed as ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c30258-9470-4e50-8974-d3a1f4438df4)
are the weights (fractions of total investment) allocated to each asset.

### Example 2: Production Costs
- **Situation:** A manufacturer incurs different variable costs, which are random due to fluctuating prices and quantities.
- **Random Variables:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99419840-9801-4acb-9c98-2d9339866345)
 representing costs of materials, labor, and utilities.
- **Linear Combination:** Total production cost, ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e159460-1cda-4604-b0bf-32d6e8fc46a2) , where ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1efdbfcc-b88d-4c23-8571-7ec1656d2a4f)
 are the quantities of each cost component used.

## Properties

### Expected Value:
The expected value of a linear combination of random variables is the linear combination of their expected values.

---

### Variance:
If the random variables are independent, the variance of their linear combination is the sum of their variances multiplied by the square of the coefficients.

### Covariance:
For non-independent variables, covariance terms also appear in the variance calculation.

## Applications
- **Risk Management:** Calculating the overall risk (variance) of a portfolio in finance.
- **Quality Control:** Estimating the variability in product quality due to different input variations.
- **Operations Research:** Modeling the total time or cost in processes involving several stochastic components.
