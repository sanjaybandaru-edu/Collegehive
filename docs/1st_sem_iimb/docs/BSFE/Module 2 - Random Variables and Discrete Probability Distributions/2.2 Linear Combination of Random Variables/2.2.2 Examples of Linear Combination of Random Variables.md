# 2.2.2 Examples of Linear Combinations of Random Variables

## Example 1: Total Cost of Production
- **Situation:** Calculating the total cost of a product based on material and labor costs, both of which are random variables.
- **Random Variables:**  
  - X1: Units of material used (random)  
  - X2: Units of labor used (random)  
- **Linear Combination:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52a5d9d7-06b8-456a-8c2e-5bfab230520e)

  - a1â€‹, a2: Per-unit costs of material and labor, respectively.  
- **Result:**  Y represents the total cost, influenced by the random quantities of material and labor.

## Example 2: Total Monthly Profit of a Retail Chain
- **Situation:** A retail chain operates several stores; monthly sales at each are random.
- **Random Variables:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e0d37ae-00e6-4b73-9913-b3874a6c1e96)
: Monthly sales in units at each of n stores.  
- **Linear Combination:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83ad78b6-be54-4eeb-b18c-6dbd9e3ea233)

  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a91924bf-396f-49bb-9257-3962fdb32c14)
: Profits per unit sold in each store.  
- **Result:**  Y represents the total monthly profit across all stores, combining individual profits adjusted by sales volumes.

## Example 3: Total Monthly Expenses of a Business
- **Situation:** A company incurs monthly expenses in various categories like personnel, marketing, etc., each being a random variable due to fluctuating costs.
- **Random Variables:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5dea48-d6f5-419e-abb5-cd6f9d45443f)
: Expenditures in each category.  
- **Linear Combination:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc8b4c1-8778-440b-b265-bcdfe01ff307)

- **Result:**  Y represents the total monthly expense of the business, aggregating all categorical expenses.

## Example 4: Average Sales Commission
- **Situation:** Sales commissions are collected by different sales reps, each commission being a random variable.
- **Random Variables:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ea157e6-653c-45ba-80b1-d368d29e9959)
: Commissions collected by n sales reps.  
- **Linear Combination:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc5e2d10-4c13-4e2d-967b-861a2684d1d5)

- **Result:**  
Y is the average sales commission per sales rep for that month.
