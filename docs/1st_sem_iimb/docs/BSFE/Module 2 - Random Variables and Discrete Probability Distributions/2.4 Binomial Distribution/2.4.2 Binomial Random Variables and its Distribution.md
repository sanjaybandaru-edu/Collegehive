# 2.4.2 Binomial Random Variables and Its Distribution

## Definition
- **Binomial Random Variable:** Counts the number of successes in a fixed number n of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success p.

### Conditions:
1. The trials are identical and independent.
2. Each trial results in only two possible outcomes: success or failure.
3. The probability of success p remains constant across trials.

- **Formula:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78773086-4c24-4eae-aa0c-87c71f1c5090)

  Where:  
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8955e1b3-187e-4380-b33c-57ecd201bb40)
 is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose k successes in n trials.  
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71a94561-b6d9-4b2a-8597-6125673e91f9)
 is the probability of k successes.  
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1383368c-1e5e-431c-a25c-8c9f90731d31)
 is the probability of n-k failures.

## Examples
1. **Coin Tosses:**  
   - A binomial experiment with multiple tosses of a coin where getting heads is considered a success.  
   - If the coin is tossed n times with a success probability p for heads, then Y counts the number of heads.

2. **Die Rolls:**  
   - Multiple rolls of a die where getting a two or less is considered a success.  
   - With n rolls and a success probability ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9321228c-c1c4-4827-a8e8-cde9038143e1)
, Y counts the number of times a two or less is rolled.

3. **Sales Calls:**  
   - A salesperson makes n sales calls, with each call independently resulting in a sale (success) with probability p.  
   - Y would count the total number of sales made.

## Calculation Example
- For 10 trials (n=10) and a success probability of p=0.5:
