# 2.4.3 Examples of Binomial Distributions

## Example 1: Biased Die
- **Context:** A biased die where the probability of rolling a 5 or 6 (success) is ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5162c1d-c2be-4343-8239-d78e755d46f4)

- **Binomial Scenario:** 10 rolls of the die, counting how many times a 5 or 6 is rolled.
- **Calculations:**
  - **Expected Number of Successes:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58c58654-b5f7-4ec7-a787-d83c80b7ac78)

  - **Standard Deviation:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a997ecd-2f9f-48b3-9cb8-94d8ea5603d2)

  - **Probability of at Least 3 Successes:** Calculated using binomial probability functions.

## Example 2: Insurance Calls
- **Context:** An insurance agent makes calls, with each call having a 20% chance of leading to a sale (success).
- **Binomial Scenario:** 12 calls made per day.
- **Questions:**
  - **Expected Number of Sales:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b9e9278-6f37-4d85-ae0d-8d0863930a1a)

  - **Probability of at Least 10 Sales:** Computed using binomial probabilities.

## Example 3: Flight Delays
- **Context:** Observing flight delays at an airport, with a day considered successful if there are two or fewer delays.
- **Binomial Scenario:** 30 days observed.
- **Calculations:**
  - **Probability of at Least 18 Successful Days:** Using the binomial distribution for n=30 and p (probability of a successful day).
  - **Probability of Between 15 and 25 Successful Days:** Summing probabilities from 15 to 25.

## Example 4: Defective Pumps
- **Context:** Monitoring production quality over several days, defining a successful day as one with one or fewer defective pumps.
- **Binomial Scenario:** 14 days monitored.
- **Questions:**
  - **Expected Number of Successful Days:** E[Y]=14Ã—p (where p is the probability of a successful day).
  - **Probability of 10 or More Successful Days:** Using cumulative binomial probabilities.

## General Methodology
- **Use a Spreadsheet to Calculate Binomial Probabilities Efficiently:**
  - **Setting Up:** Enter n (number of trials) and p (probability of success) into the spreadsheet.
  - **Using Binomial Functions:** Apply Excel's `BINOM.DIST` function to compute probabilities for various outcomes.
  - **Analysis:** Analyze scenarios by varying p and checking effects on probabilities, using either direct calculation or goal-seeking methods in Excel.
