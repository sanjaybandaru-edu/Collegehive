# 2.4.4 Recap of Binomial Distribution

## Key Characteristics of a Binomial Experiment
1. **Identical and Independent Trials:** Each trial in the experiment is identical, meaning the probability of success remains constant across trials, and trials are independent of one another.
2. **Two Outcomes per Trial:** Each trial has only two possible outcomes—success or failure.
3. **Fixed Number of Trials:** The number of trials, denoted as n, is predetermined before the experiment begins.
4. **Consistent Probability of Success:** The probability of success, denoted as p, does not change from one trial to the next.

## Properties of the Binomial Random Variable
1. **Counts the Number of Successes:** A binomial random variable sums up the total number of successes across n trials.
2. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** Given by the formula

   where:
   - k represents the number of successes,
   - n is the total number of trials,
   - p is the probability of success,
   - (1-p) is the probability of failure.
3. **Mean and Variance:**
   - **Mean (Expected Value):** E[Y]=np
   - **Variance:** Var(Y)=np(1−p)

## When Binomial Conditions are Not Met
- If the assumptions of identical trials or independence between trials are not met, the distribution may not be binomial. 
- In such cases, other probability distributions or models might be more appropriate.

## Practical Application and Limitations
- Binomial distributions model a wide range of real-world phenomena, such as coin tosses, quality control in manufacturing (like defect rates), and customer behavior (like conversion rates in marketing).
- However, it's crucial to validate that the assumptions hold reasonably well in practice, or adjustments may be necessary.
