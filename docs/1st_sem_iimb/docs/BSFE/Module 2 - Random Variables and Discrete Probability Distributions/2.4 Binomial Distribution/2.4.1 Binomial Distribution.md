# 2.4.1 Bernoulli Random Variable and its Distribution

## Definition
- **Bernoulli Random Variable:** A discrete random variable that takes only two possible outcomes, typically coded as 1 (success) and 0 (failure).
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**  f(y)=p if y=1 and f(y)=1−p if y=0, where p is the probability of success and q = 1−p is the probability of failure.

## Examples
1. **Coin Toss:**  
   - Success (Heads) = 1 with probability p
   - Failure (Tails) = 0 with probability 1-p 

2. **Sales Call:**  
   - Success (Sale made) = 1 with probability p
   - Failure (No sale) = 0 with probability 1-p
3. **Customer Survey:**  
   - Success (Satisfied) = 1 with probability p
   - Failure (Not satisfied) = 0 with probability 1-p

4. **Store Demand:**  
   - Success (Demand > 10 units) = 1 with probability p 
   - Failure (Demand ≤ 10 units) = 0 with probability 1-p

## Application
- **Die Toss:**  
  Define success for getting a number less than or equal to 2 on a fair six-sided die: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f81d0858-06d8-412c-8b50-8fd34e8cd34c)
