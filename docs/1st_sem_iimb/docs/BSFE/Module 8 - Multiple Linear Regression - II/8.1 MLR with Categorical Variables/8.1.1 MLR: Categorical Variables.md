# 8.1.1 MLR: Categorical Variables

## MLR Review
- **Definition:** A model predicting a dependent variable y using multiple independent variables ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44deff7d-748c-4323-af95-425c9b5825ff)

- **Extension:** In this module, categorical (qualitative) variables are introduced as independent variables alongside quantitative variables.
  - **Example:** Flat prices might depend not only on area (quantitative) but also on whether the location is premium or not (categorical).

---

## Why Include Categorical Variables?
- **Improved Predictions:** Categorical variables often provide crucial context not captured by quantitative data.
  - **Example:** In Mysuru flat price data:
    - Quantitative variables: Area, bathrooms, bedrooms.
    - Missing categorical variables: Amenities, apartment type, premium location.

## Handling Categorical Variables
- **Key Concept:** Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form (dummy variables) for regression.
- **Dummy Variables:** Binary variables (0 or 1) representing categories.
  - **Example:** Brand variable in Basavaraja's dataset.

## Steps in MLR with Categorical Variables

### Model Formulation:
- Basic regression equation:  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2b220a8-78c2-4506-a2f6-30bca4ab7648)

- x1​: Price (quantitative).  
- x2: Brand (categorical, represented as dummy variable).

### Data Analysis:
- Include both x1 and x2​ in the regression model.
- Use tools like Excel's Analysis ToolPak to calculate coefficients, ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1adc00b-0953-4fad-9eae-57452c9354a9)
 , standard error, and ANOVA table.

### Example Calculation:
- **Basavaraja's dataset:** Satisfaction score depends on:
  - Price (x1): Quantitative.
  - Brand (x2): Lenovo (1) or Dell (0).
- **Regression Equation:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb264c2f-c140-4b94-8363-3d3e72f1a9d9)

## Results and Interpretations

### Performance Improvement:
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5625b88d-2655-4a62-b312-85f1431b3f9e)
 improved from 0.31 (price only) to 0.45 (price + brand).
- Standard error reduced from 5.19 to 4.85.

### Significance Tests:
- **F-test (overall significance):**
  - Null hypothesis: No linear relationship.
  - F-statistic: 13.75 (p-value close to 0). Reject null hypothesis, indicating the model is significant.
- **T-tests (individual significance):**

    - Price significantly influences satisfaction score.

    - Brand also significantly impacts satisfaction.

### Adding categorical variables (e.g., brand):
- Enhances the model's explanatory power and predictive accuracy.
- **Interpretation of coefficients:**
  - β1: Satisfaction score increases by 1.29 units for every 1-lakh increase in price.
  - β2: Lenovo users score 3.93 units higher than Dell users, on average.

## Simplified Explanation

### What is Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)?
- It's like finding a formula to predict something (e.g., satisfaction score) using several factors (e.g., price, brand).

### What’s New?
- Previously, we only used numbers (e.g., price).
- Now, we also include labels like brand (Lenovo, Dell) by turning them into numbers (dummy variables: 1 or 0).

### Why Do This?
- Labels (categories) can also influence predictions. Including them improves accuracy.

### How Do We Use It?
- **Example:**  
  - Satisfaction = 46.83 + (1.29 x price) + (3.93 x brand).  
  - If it’s Lenovo, brand = 1.  
  - If Dell, brand = 0.
