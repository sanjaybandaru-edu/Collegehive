### Baseline Model
#### Initial Model:
- **Dependent variable (y):** Selling price (in lakhs).  
- **Independent variable (x1):** Area (in square feet).
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f91251-461d-48ee-a198-80cadd2ded9f)

#### Limitations:
- Adding quantitative variables (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms) led to multicollinearity issues, as these variables were highly correlated with area.

### Step 1: Adding a Categorical Variable (Premium Location)
#### New Model:
- **Dependent variable (y):** Selling price.  
- **Independent variables:**
  - x1: Area (quantitative).  
  - x2: Premium location (categorical; x2 = 1 for premium, x2 = 0 otherwise).

### Step 2: Adding Multiple Categorical Variables
#### Additional Variables:
- x3: Amenities (1 if present, 0 otherwise).  
- x4: Gated community (1 if gated, 0 otherwise).

#### New Model:

## Residual Analysis

### 1. Standardized Residuals:
- No values exceeding Â±3.
- Adding categorical variables improved the fit.
### 2. Plots of Residuals:
- Residuals vs. independent variables ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3993937c-51c0-4451-93f5-950559a2c156)
 Random distribution, no patterns, indicating no bias.
- Residuals vs. predicted values ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6e9398-62ef-460d-9208-2902c1ba7850)
 Equally distributed above and below the x-axis.
