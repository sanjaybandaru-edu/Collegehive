Where:  
- β0: Intercept.  
- β1: Coefficient for x1​ (quantitative variable).  
- β2: Coefficient for x2 (categorical dummy variable).

### Example with Basavaraja's Dataset:
- **Regression Equation:**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2791542-bc44-4c80-88fd-3a3a05726e77)

  - x1: Price of the computer.  
  - x2 = 0: Dell.  
  - x2 = 1: Lenovo.  

- **Predictions:**

  - Interpretation: Lenovo scores 3.93 points higher on average than Dell.

---

## Residual Analysis
- **Residuals vs. x1 (price):** Appear evenly distributed around the x-axis.  
- **Residuals vs. x2 (dummy variable):** Clustered at the two dummy values (0 or 1).  
- **No major outliers:** A few residuals above or below ±2.

## When There are More Categories
- **Scenario:** Three brands (Lenovo, Dell, Asus).  
- **Use k - 1 dummy variables for \( k \) categories:**

### Interpretation of Coefficients:
- β0​: Average satisfaction score for Asus.  
- β1: Difference between Lenovo and Asus.  
- β2: Difference between Dell and Asus.

### Alternative Baseline:
- Change the reference category.  
  - **Example:** Use Lenovo as the baseline.  
    - β0: Average score for Lenovo.  
    - β1: Difference between Asus and Lenovo.  
    - β2: Difference between Dell and Lenovo.

## Simplified Explanation

### What is Happening?
- Categorical data (e.g., brands) must be converted into numbers (0s and 1s) to fit into the regression model.

### Why Use Dummy Variables?
- Dummy variables allow categorical factors to be analyzed in regression.

### How Do We Interpret Results?
- Each category (e.g., Dell or Lenovo) changes the regression equation slightly.  
- **Example:** Lenovo gives an average satisfaction score \( 3.93 \) points higher than Dell.

### What Happens with 3+ Categories?
- Use multiple dummy variables. For 3 brands:
  - Assign 1s and 0s to represent two of the brands.
  - The third acts as a baseline for comparison.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Dummy variables allow you to analyze categorical factors like brands.  
- The choice of baseline category (e.g., Asus or Lenovo) affects how results are interpreted but not the overall conclusion.
