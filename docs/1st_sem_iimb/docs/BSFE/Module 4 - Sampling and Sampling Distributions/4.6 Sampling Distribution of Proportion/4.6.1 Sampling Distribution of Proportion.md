# 4.6.1 Sampling Distribution of Proportion

### Introduction
- **Purpose:** Understanding the sampling distribution of the sample proportion (p̄) and its implications for statistical inference.

### Understanding Sample Proportions
- **Definition:** The sample proportion p̄ is a point estimator for the population proportion p. It is calculated as p̄ = x/n, where x is the number of elements in the sample with a characteristic of interest.
- **Example:** In a customer satisfaction survey, if 17 out of 36 customers are satisfied, the sample proportion p̄ is 0.47.

### Properties of Sampling Distribution
- **Expected Value:** The expected value of p̄ is the population proportion p, making p̄ an unbiased estimator of p.
- **Standard Deviation (Standard Error):** The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of p̄ is calculated as √(p(1-p)/n).
- **Shape of the Distribution:** The distribution of p̄ approaches normality as the sample size n increases, a result supported by the Central Limit Theorem when n is large enough (usually n > 30).

### Practical Applications
- **Probability Estimations:** 
  - Example: Estimating the likelihood that the sample proportion will be within a certain range of the population proportion.
  - Calculation involves determining the standard error and using the normal approximation to estimate probabilities.

### Example: Medical Survey
- **Scenario:** A survey aims to estimate the proportion of patients receiving unnecessary medical treatments.
- **Survey Details:** A sample size of 150 is considered large enough to use the normal approximation.
- **Probability Questions:** 
  - The probability that the sample proportion is within a specific interval around the population proportion.
  - The probability that the sample proportion exceeds a certain threshold.

### Conclusion
- **Importance:** The sampling distribution of proportion is crucial in planning and interpreting surveys and experiments where proportion estimates are required.
- **Utility:** Helps in determining the adequacy of sample sizes and in making probabilistic predictions about survey outcomes based on sample data.
