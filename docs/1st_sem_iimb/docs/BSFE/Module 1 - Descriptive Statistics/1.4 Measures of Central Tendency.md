# 1.4 Measures of Central Tendency
It is a form of Numerical Summaries, along with Dispersion and Variance.

## Mean
Measure of the center location of a data set.  
- **μ:** Population (Total data set)  
- **͞x:** Sample (An extract of selected data from the full data set)  
  - It is also the point estimator for μ.  
- **For Excel:** `=AVERAGE()`

## Median
- The middle value or the average of the 2 middle values.  
- It is preferred when there are outliers and the mean is affected.

## Mode
The most repeating value (or multiple values that repeat the same number of times).  
- **Unimodal:** When there is 1 mode value.  
- **Bimodal:** When there are 2 mode values.  
- **Multimodal:** When there are more than 2 mode values.  
- **For Excel:** `MODE.SNGL` / `MODE.MULT`

## Percentiles
Describes the spread of the data from the smallest to largest value.  
- **p% of observations** are lesser than the p percentile, **100-p% of observations** are greater than the p percentile.  
- P percentile shows how much percent of the values are lesser than or greater than p.

- Arrange in ascending order and compute the index.  
  - If the value of Lp is an integer, it can directly be read from the data.  
  - If the value of Lp is not an integer, use linear interpolation.  
**For Excel:** `PERCENTILE.EXE(array, k)`

## Quartiles
- Specific percentiles. All steps for computing percentiles can be directly applied to quartiles.  
- Quartiles are broken into **25, 50, 75, and 100 percentiles.**
