# 1.6 Five Number Summaries and Box Plots

A Five Number Summary uses five key statistics to describe a dataset:
1. **Minimum:** Smallest value in the dataset.
2. **Q1 (First Quartile):** 25th percentile, indicating the value below which 25% of the data lies.
3. **Median (Q2):** 50th percentile, the middle value of the dataset.
4. **Q3 (Third Quartile):** 75th percentile, indicating the value below which 75% of the data lies.
5. **Maximum:** Largest value in the dataset.

### Example:
**Jyothi's salary data:**
- Minimum: 18 lakhs.
- Q1: 24 lakhs.
- Median: 25 lakhs.
- Q3: 27 lakhs.
- Maximum: 50 lakhs.

## Box and Whisker Plot
A Box and Whisker Plot visually represents the Five Number Summary and highlights the spread and outliers.

### Components:
1. **Box:**
   - Ends of the box represent Q1 and Q3.
   - A line inside the box marks the median (Q2).
   - Sometimes, the mean is indicated (e.g., by a cross).
   
2. **Whiskers:**
   - Extend from the box to the smallest and largest values within **1.5 × IQR** below Q1 and above Q3.
   - **IQR (Interquartile Range):** IQR = Q3 - Q1.
   
3. **Outliers:**
   - Values outside the whisker limits are marked (e.g., as small circles).

## Outlier Detection

### Whisker Limits:
- **Lower Limit:** Q1 - 1.5 × IQR.
- **Upper Limit:** Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.

### Example (Jyothi's salary data):
- **IQR:** 27 - 24 = 3 lakhs.
- **Lower Limit:** 24 - (1.5 × 3) = 21 lakhs.
- **Upper Limit:** 27 + (1.5 × 3) = 31 lakhs.
- **Outliers:** 18, 32, 35, 38, and 50 lakhs.

## Comparison with Z-Score Method
- Z-scores: Identify outliers based on their distance from the mean (e.g., |Z| > 3).
- Box plots: Identify outliers based on IQR and whisker limits.
- In Jyothi's salary data:
  - **Z-Score Outliers:** 38 lakhs, 50 lakhs.
  - **Box Plot Outliers:** 18 lakhs, 32 lakhs, 35 lakhs, 38 lakhs, 50 lakhs.

## Interpretation
- Combining methods (**Box Plot** and **Z-Score**) enhances reliability in identifying outliers.
- Visualization via box plots provides intuitive insights into data spread and potential anomalies.
