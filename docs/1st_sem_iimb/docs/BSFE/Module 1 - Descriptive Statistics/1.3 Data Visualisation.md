## Frequency Distribution - Categorical
- Summary of data that shows frequency in each of several non-overlapping categories. It gives quick and convenient visuals for required data.

### Tabular
Representing data using tables

### Bar Chart
Bars that raise to equal the y-axis (frequency) values corresponding to the x-axis (Level of satisfaction).  
- Frequently used for the distribution of categorical or quantitative data.

### Side-by-Side Bar Chart
To compare multiple bar charts.  
- It is useful when comparing the same variable (or multiple similar variables) of 2 or more elements.

### Stacked Bar Charts
- It is presented in a similar format to a pie chart. It takes the total frequency of each variable and shows the distribution between the elements.

### Stacked Percentage Bar Chart
Similar to the above, it is broken into percentage frequency and shows the percentage distribution of the elements (chosen when the absolute number is not important).

### Relative Frequency (Always adds up to 1)
Frequency of value relative to total observations  
- **Formula:** Frequency / n observations  
- **Percentage Frequency:** Relative Frequency x 100

### Pie Chart
- The relative ratio is multiplied by 360 (degrees in a circle) to get the sector of each attribute.  
- The size of each sector is proportional to the relative frequency.  
- Used to show the relative frequency of categorical data.

- It is recommended to mention the percentage or absolute value for easier visualization.

#### Groups
- Groups are non-overlapping classes of a specified width.  
- When grouping, keeping width constant across the groups is important.  
- The number of classes should be between 5 to 10.

#### Cumulative Frequency
Adding the frequencies up to the selected group.

#### Histogram
- Similar to a bar chart but with no separation.  
- Helps see the trends easier and makes asymmetries easier to visualize.  
- It is used more frequently in quantitative data.

#### Scatter Plot
- Display of the relationship between 2 variables.  
- Sometimes, a trend line is drawn to better visualize the relationship between the 2 variables.
