### Interval
Where only the interval denoted by some fixed unit has relevance. It is a scale in which 0 also does not have any significance. In interval data, the ratio of the data does not have much relevance.
  - Timer:  If a time has intervals of 2 seconds, the measurements are taken at the intervals.
  - Temperature: Where 2 cups with water at 10 and 30 deg celsius respectively, The second cup is not 3x as hot as the water in the first cup. It is also measured in intervals depending on the thermometer used. Here, although the water can be at 0 deg, it does not have any meaning.
  - Adjusted GPA for both core and elective courses is quantitative interval data. It is a quantitative numeric value between an interval of 2 to 10.

### Ratio
Where 0 has meaning and the ratio between the data has significance. 
  - 2 businesses; where 1st is making a profit of 1L and 2nd is making a profit of  2L. Here the second business is making 2x the profit of the first business. And a business making 0 profit is breaking even. 
  - Age; At the time of recording the data, A 20 year old is twice as old as a 10 year old and a new-born has an age of 0.. The ratio between the age has significance and 0 denotes a new-born.
  - Age and Overall score are both ratios. That is because the overall score is measured from 0 to 100. however, If it was SAT scores it would be on an interval scale because it is measured on a scale from 200 to 800.

### Cross-Sectional Data
When the full data set is collected in a fixed time frame. Any type of data with however many variables, if collected in a fixed time frame is considered a Cross-Sectional Data. 
**Example:** Multiple companies' revenue in 1 month. 

### Time Series
When data is collected over multiple time intervals.
**Example:** A companyâ€™s revenue over several months.
