# 1.9 Properties of Probability

## Key Properties:

### Union of Two Events (A ∪ B):
- Represents all outcomes in event A, event B, or both.
- **Venn Diagram:** Union is the combined area of two circles (A and B), including the overlap.
- **Example:** For movies KGF (event A) and Kantara (event B):

- **Interpretation:** 76% chance either or both movies are a hit.

### Intersection of Two Events (A ∩ B):
- Represents outcomes common to both events A and B.
- **Venn Diagram:** Intersection is the overlapping area of two circles (A and B).
- **Example:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722ff075-95ca-4e67-9eea-b1baea4eeda1)

  - **Outcomes:** {8, 9, 11, 12} with probabilities \( 0.08 + 0.02 + 0.06 + 0.02 \).

### Addition Law:
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
  \]
- Simplifies to \( P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) \) if A and B are mutually exclusive (no overlap).

### Mutually Exclusive Events:
- Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur simultaneously.
- **Example:** Tossing a coin results in either heads (A) or tails (B) but not both.

## Basic Requirements for Probabilities:
1. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8078edf-cd88-4bea-b697-7e16bfce870b)
for any event E.
2. The sum of probabilities of all sample space outcomes = 1.

## Applications:
- **Union:** Probability that either or both events occur (e.g., a hit movie).
- **Intersection:** Probability that both events occur (e.g., both movies are hits).
- **Mutual Exclusivity:** Simplifies addition law when events have no overlap.
