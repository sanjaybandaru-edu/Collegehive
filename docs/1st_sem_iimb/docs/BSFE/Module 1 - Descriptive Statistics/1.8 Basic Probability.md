# 1.8 Basic Probability

## Key Concepts:

### Probability:
- Numerical measure of the likelihood of an event.
- **Ranges from 0 to 1**:
  - **0:** Event is impossible.
  - **1:** Event is certain.
  - **0.5:** Event is equally likely or unlikely.

### Random Experiment:
- A process with more than one possible outcome.
- **Example:** Revenue outcomes for movies KGF (3, 4, 5, 6 lakhs) and Kantara (4, 5, 6 lakhs).

### Sample Space (S):
- Set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
- **Example:** Combining outcomes for KGF and Kantara yields 12 outcomes in the sample space.

### Event (A):
- A subset of the sample space, representing outcomes of interest.
- **Example:** Event A (KGF is a hit) includes outcomes where revenue is 5 or 6 lakhs.

### Complement of an Event (A'):
- Consists of all outcomes in the sample space not in event A.
- **Example:** If A = {KGF is a hit}, then A' = {KGF is not a hit}.

## Rules of Probability:

### Assignment:
- Probability of any outcome is between 0 and 1.
- The sum of probabilities of all outcomes in the sample space is 1.

### Calculating Event Probability:
- Sum the probabilities of all outcomes within the event.
- **Example:**
  - **Event A:** KGF is a hit (revenue ≥ 5 lakhs).
    - **Outcomes:** {5, 6 lakhs}.
    - **Probabilities:** 0.1 + 0.08 + … = **0.34**.
  - **Event B:** Kantara is a hit (revenue ≥ 5 lakhs).
    - **Outcomes:** {5, 6 lakhs}.
    - **Probabilities:** 0.1 + 0.1 + … = **0.6**.

### Complement Rule:
- \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) \).
- **Example:**
  - For **Event A**: \( P(A) = 0.34 \) → \( P(A') = 1 - 0.34 = 0.66 \).
  - For **Event B**: \( P(B) = 0.6 \) → \( P(B') = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 \).

## Application Example:

### KGF Revenue:
- **Possible values:** 3, 4, 5, 6 lakhs.
- **Probability KGF is a hit (≥ 5 lakhs):** 0.34.
- **Complement (not a hit):** 0.66.

### Kantara Revenue:
- **Possible values:** 4, 5, 6 lakhs.
- **Probability Kantara is a hit (≥ 5 lakhs):** 0.6.
- **Complement (not a hit):** 0.4.

- **Sample space** represented as a rectangle.
- **Events** represented as circles.
- **Complements** shown as the area outside the circle but inside the rectangle.
