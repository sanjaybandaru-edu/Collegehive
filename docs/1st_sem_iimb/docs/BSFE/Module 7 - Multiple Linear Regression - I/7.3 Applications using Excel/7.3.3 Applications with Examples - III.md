# 7.3.3 Applications with Examples - III

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session expands on multiple linear regression (MLR) applications by incorporating three independent variables—first income, monthly payment, and utilities—to analyze household debt.
- **Context:** Manjula Naik continues her analysis using a more complex MLR model to understand how various financial factors contribute to household debt.

### Enhancing the Model
- **Previous Findings:** Previous models with two variables provided adjusted R-squared values of 0.67 and 0.45, indicating significant but varying explanations of debt variability.
- **New Approach:** Incorporating first income, monthly payment, and utilities into one comprehensive model to capture a broader spectrum of influencing factors.

### Methodology
- **Data Preparation:**
  - **Variables:** Debt (Y), first income (X1), monthly payment (X2), and utilities (X3).
  - **Location in Spreadsheet:** Debt in column K, first income in column H, monthly payments in column I, and utilities in column J.

### Regression Analysis
- **Tool Used:** Analysis ToolPak in Excel for regression computation.
- **Model Specification:** A full MLR model with debt as a function of first income, monthly payment, and utilities.
- **Statistical Outputs:**
  - **R-squared:** Improved to 0.708, indicating that 70.8% of the variability in household debt is now explained by the model.
  - **Adjusted R-squared:** Slightly lower than R-squared, around 0.70, indicating minimal overfitting despite the increased number of predictors.
  - **Standard Error:** Reduced to 18699, suggesting increased precision in the model's estimates.

### Model Assessment
- **ANOVA Results:**
  - **SSR:** Increased significantly, indicating better explanation of variance by the model.
  - **SSE:** Decreased, which aligns with the lower standard error and higher explanatory power.
- **F-Statistic:** 401.6, with a very low p-value, strongly supporting the model's overall significance.

### Coefficient Analysis
- **Interpretation of Coefficients:**
  - **B1 (First Income):** Each unit increase in first income increases debt by 0.017 units.
  - **B2 (Monthly Payment):** Each unit increase in monthly payment increases debt by 0.96 units.
  - **B3 (Utilities):** Each unit increase in utilities increases debt by 157.95 units.
- **Significance:** All coefficients are significant, indicating a meaningful contribution to the model.

### Residuals and Diagnostics
- **Residuals:** Standardized residuals mostly within the range of \(\pm3\), suggesting well-behaved errors.
- **Residual Plots:** Random patterns across all independent variables and predicted values, affirming the model's adequacy.

### Conclusion
- **Model Validation:** The enhanced MLR model significantly improves understanding and prediction of household debt dynamics.
- **Future Directions:** Encouraged to explore additional datasets and further refine modeling techniques to handle complex business scenarios.
