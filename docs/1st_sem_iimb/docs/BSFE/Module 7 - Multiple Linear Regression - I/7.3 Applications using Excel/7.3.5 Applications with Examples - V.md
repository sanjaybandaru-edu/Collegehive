# 7.3.5 Applications with Examples - V

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session aims to enhance the predictive power of the regression model by incorporating additional quantitative variables into the analysis.
- **Context:** Vijay Gowda, a real estate analyst for Magic Bricks, is analyzing property prices in Jayalakshmi Puram, Mysore. He aims to improve his previous model's R-squared value of 0.44 by adding more variables.

### Data and Initial Analysis
- **Data Set:** Includes 30 observations with variables like selling price, area in square feet, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
- **Initial Model:** Simple linear regression with area as the sole predictor, yielding an R-squared of 0.44, indicating that 44% of the variability in selling prices is explained by area alone.

### Enhancing the Model
- **New Variables:** Consideration of additional quantitative variables such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to possibly improve the model.
- **Initial Thoughts:** Bedrooms and bathrooms are initially considered quantitative variables, but are clarified to be qualitative due to their categorical nature (i.e., their numeric values signify categories without intrinsic ordering).

### Multiple Linear Regression Development
- **Variable Selection:** Area in square feet and number of bedrooms are selected for the new MLR model.
- **Excel Analysis ToolPak Usage:** The selling price is set as the dependent variable (Y), with area and number of bedrooms as independent variables (X1 and X2).

### Model Outputs and Analysis
- **Regression Output:** The regression analysis is conducted, focusing on computing residuals, standardized residuals, and residual plots.
- **R-squared Analysis:** The new MLR model yields an R-squared slightly higher than the simple model but still under expectations, prompting further analysis.

### Diagnostics and Learning
- **Adjusted R-squared:** Remains close to the R-squared, confirming the modest increase in explanatory power.
- **Standard Error:** Comparable to the simple linear regression, indicating consistency in the model's predictive error.
- **ANOVA Output:** Shows an increase in SSR (sum of squares regression) with the addition of bedrooms, although not dramatically.

### Hypothesis Testing and Coefficients
- **F-Statistic:** Indicates a significant overall model fit, suggesting that the model variables collectively influence selling prices.
- **Coefficient Analysis:** Examines the impact of each variable, with area showing a significant relationship with selling price, whereas bedrooms do not show a statistically significant effect, possibly due to multicollinearity.

### Conclusion and Next Steps
- **Model Assessment:** The inclusion of bedrooms did not significantly improve the model as expected, highlighting the potential issue of multicollinearity.
- **Future Directions:** Suggests the inclusion of qualitative variables in future models and plans to cover this approach in the next module.
