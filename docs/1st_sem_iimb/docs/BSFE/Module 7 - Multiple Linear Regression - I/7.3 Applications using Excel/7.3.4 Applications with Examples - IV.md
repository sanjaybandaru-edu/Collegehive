# 7.3.4 Applications with Examples - IV

### Introduction
- **Objective:** Explore the application of simple and multiple linear regression to model selling prices of flats based on area in square feet and potentially other variables.
- **Context:** Vijay Gowda, a real estate analyst working for Magic Bricks, uses a dataset from Jayalakshmi Puram in Mysuru to determine market rates for flats.

### Data Overview
- **Dataset Characteristics:** Consists of 30 observations including variables such as selling price, area (square feet), number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and features like premium locality, gated complex, and amenities.
- **Initial Analysis:** Begins with a simple linear regression model focusing on area as the independent variable to predict selling prices.

### Initial Model Development
- **Scatter Plot Analysis:**
  - Reveals a rough linear trend but indicates potential outliers.
  - **Trend Line Equation:** \(y = 28.37 + 0.0968x\), where \(x\) is the area in square feet.
  - **Coefficient of Determination (\(R^2\)):** Initially found to be 0.44, suggesting moderate explanatory power.

### Comprehensive Regression Analysis
- **Tool Used:** Excel's Analysis ToolPak.
- **Regression Details:**
  - **Dependent Variable (Y):** Selling price.
  - **Independent Variable (X):** Area in square feet.
- **Outputs to Generate:** Regression results, residuals, standardized residuals, and their plots.

### Regression Results and Interpretation
- **\(R^2\) Value Confirmation:** Confirmed at 0.44 from Excel, aligning with the preliminary analysis.
- **Adjusted \(R^2\):** Stands at approximately 0.43, consistent across models indicating the model's stability.
- **Standard Error:** Noted at 70.57, representing an estimate of the standard deviation of the regression errors.

### ANOVA Table Insights
- **SSR (Sum of Squares due to Regression):** 111539.
- **SSE (Sum of Squares due to Error):** 139462.
- **SST (Total Sum of Squares):** 251001, with SSR accounting for about 44% of SST.

### Further Statistical Measures
- **MSR (Mean Square Regression):** Equal to SSR in this single-variable model at 111539.
- **MSE (Mean Square Error):** Computed as 4981, based on 28 degrees of freedom.
- **F-Statistic:** Calculated as 22.39, indicating the regression provides a significant fit to the data.
- **P-Value:** Close to zero, strongly supporting the rejection of the null hypothesis (\(\beta_1 = 0\)).

### Hypothesis Testing for Slope
- **Coefficient \(b_1\):** Indicates a price increase of 0.09 lakhs (90,000) per square foot increase.
- **T-Statistic for \(b_1\):** 4.73, with 28 degrees of freedom, suggesting significant impact of area on selling price.

### Residual Analysis
- **Standardized Residuals:** Some exceed \(\pm3\), potential outliers.
- **Residual Plots:** Show randomness, supporting the modelâ€™s assumptions of homogeneity and independence.

### Conclusion
- **Model Evaluation:** Demonstrates a significant relationship between area and selling price, with room for model improvement by adding more variables.
- **Next Steps:** Proposes developing a multiple linear regression model to include additional predictive factors, enhancing explanatory power and accuracy.
