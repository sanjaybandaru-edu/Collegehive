# 7.3.1 Applications with Examples - I

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session illustrates the application of multiple linear regression (MLR) using real-world data to determine factors influencing household debt.
- **Context:** Manjula Nayak from 99acres is analyzing a dataset from a household survey in Bengaluru to understand the determinants of household debt, specifically looking at household income and monthly payments.

### Data Overview
- **Dataset:** Consists of approximately 500 observations from a household survey in Bengaluru.
- **Variables:** Includes household size, residential location, monthly income, and monthly payments.
- **Goal:** To identify if household income and monthly payments significantly determine household debt.

### Methodology
- **Regression Analysis Setup:**
  - **Dependent Variable (Y):** Household debt.
  - **Independent Variables (X1 and X2):** First income and monthly payments, respectively.
  - **Data Columns:** Debt (Column K), first income (Column H), and monthly payments (Column I).

### Analytical Tools
- **Tool Used:** Analysis tool pack in Excel.
- **Procedure:** Conduct regression analysis with household debt as the dependent variable and first income and monthly payments as independent variables.

### Statistical Analysis
- **Residuals and Standardization:**
  - Calculation of residuals and standardized residuals to assess model fit and assumptions.
  - Creation of plots for visual inspection of residual distribution and anomalies.

### Results and Interpretation
- **R-Squared Value:** Increased from 0.31 (with only first income) to 0.45 in the MLR model, indicating an improvement in model fit with the addition of monthly payments.
- **Adjusted R-Squared:** Close to the R-squared value at approximately 0.448, indicating that the model adequately adjusts for the number of predictors.
- **Standard Error:** Decreased compared to the individual regression models, suggesting better precision with the inclusion of two independent variables.

### ANOVA and Regression Output
- **SSR and SSE:** Noted significant sums of squares for regression and error, with SSR increasing in the MLR model compared to single-variable models.
- **F-Statistic:** Indicates the overall significance of the regression model with a very low p-value, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis that both beta coefficients are zero.

### Coefficient Analysis
- **Interpretation of Coefficients:**
  - **B1 (First Income):** A unit increase in first income, holding monthly payments constant, increases debt by 0.025.
  - **B2 (Monthly Payments):** A unit increase in monthly payments, holding first income constant, increases debt by 2.09.
- **Significance Tests:** Both coefficients are significant with very low p-values, confirming their influence on household debt.

### Conclusion
- **Implications:** The analysis demonstrates a significant relationship between household debt and both first income and monthly payments.
- **Further Analysis:** Suggests conducting further MLR with additional variables like utilities to explore other potential influences on debt.
