# 7.1.6 MLR - Residual Analysis

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session examines the application of both the F-test and T-test in multiple linear regression to assess the significance of model parameters and the overall model.
- **Context:** Understanding these tests helps to validate the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable within the regression framework.

### Application of the F-test
- **Scenario:** Analyzing Hanumantha's dataset which explores monthly credit card expenditure as a function of annual income and household size.
- **Hypothesis Setup:**
  - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)):** \(\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0\) (Neither annual income nor household size affects monthly spend).
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\)):** \(\beta_1 \neq 0\) or \(\beta_2 \neq 0\) (At least one of the coefficients significantly affects monthly spend).
- **F-test Results:**
  - Derived from the regression output, the F-statistic calculated as the ratio of the mean square regression (MSR) to the mean square error (MSE) is 104.63, with a p-value close to 0, indicating a strong rejection of \(H_0\).

### Application of the T-test
- **Purpose:** To determine the significance of individual regression coefficients.
- **Procedure:**
  - For each parameter (\(\beta_i\)), the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) is \(\beta_i = 0\) (the variable does not affect the dependent variable).
  - The alternative hypothesis (\(H_a\)) is \(\beta_i \neq 0\) (the variable significantly affects the dependent variable).
- **Calculations:**
  - The test statistic is computed as the ratio of the estimated coefficient (\(b_i\)) to its standard error (s of \(b_i\)).
  - For example, \(b_1\) (associated with annual income) was found to be significant with a test statistic of 10.28, and a p-value close to 0.
  - Similarly, \(b_2\) (associated with household size) showed a test statistic of 6.29, further supporting significant influence.

### Conclusion
- **Insights from Analysis:**
  - Both the F-test and individual T-tests validate significant relationships in the model, suggesting that both annual income and household size significantly impact monthly credit card expenditure.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Building on these findings, future sessions will explore further diagnostic checks and additional regression methods to refine the predictive capabilities of the models developed.

### Reflection
- **Interactive Learning:** The session included interactive discussions led by Tejas and Ashwini, helping to contextualize theoretical concepts within practical applications, enhancing learning outcomes for all participants.
