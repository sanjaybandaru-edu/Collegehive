# 7.1.1 Multiple Linear Regression

### Introduction
- **Objective:** Transition from simple linear regression to multiple linear regression, expanding the analysis to include multiple independent variables affecting a single dependent variable.
- **Overview:** This session introduces multiple linear regression (MLR), exploring its theoretical foundation, model construction, and applications in business analytics.

### Multiple Linear Regression Basics
- **Definition:** Multiple linear regression (MLR) extends simple linear regression by allowing the dependent variable to be influenced by multiple independent variables.

### Conceptual Framework
- **Model Parameters:** Discussion on estimating the coefficients that best fit the data using the least squares method.
- **Error Term Assumptions:** Maintaining assumptions from simple linear regression, such as the expectation of the error term being zero, ensuring unbiased estimates.

### Steps to Build and Validate an MLR Model
- **Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources like ERP systems or government census data, focusing on both primary and secondary sources.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Addressing data quality, handling missing data, and transforming variables as necessary.
- **Descriptive Analytics:** Using statistics and visualization to understand data properties and the relationships between variables.
- **Modeling Strategy:** Selecting the appropriate independent variables, ensuring they are independent of each other to avoid multicollinearity.
- **Model Development:** Formulating the regression equation and estimating parameters using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
- **Model Diagnostics:** Performing tests for statistical significance (F-test and T-test) and checking for multicollinearity, normality of residuals, and heteroscedasticity.
- **Model Validation:** Using measures like \(R^2\), Adjusted \(R^2\), Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and Root Mean Square Error to assess model performance on validation datasets.

### Practical Application
- **Real-World Example:** Discusses how MLR can be applied to enhance predictions in scenarios where multiple factors influence a business outcome, such as predicting sales based on pricing, advertising spend, and economic conditions.

### Conclusion
- **Model Implementation:** The final steps involve deploying the model in a real-world setting, monitoring its performance, and making necessary adjustments based on ongoing results.
- **Continuous Learning:** Emphasizes the iterative nature of model development and the importance of continual learning and adaptation in business statistics.

### Next Steps
- **Advanced Topics:** The course will continue to explore deeper aspects of regression analysis, including interaction effects among variables and more complex statistical methods to handle data challenges.
