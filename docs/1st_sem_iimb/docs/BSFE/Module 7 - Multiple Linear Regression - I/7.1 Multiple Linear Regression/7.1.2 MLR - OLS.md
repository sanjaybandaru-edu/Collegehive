# 7.1.2 MLR - OLS

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session delves into Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to model relationships involving more than one independent variable.
- **Context:** Building on the concepts from simple linear regression, MLR provides a more nuanced analysis by incorporating multiple predictors, enhancing the model's explanatory power.

### Fundamentals of MLR
- **Multiple Linear Regression Equation:**
  - MLR extends the linear regression framework to include multiple predictors
  - Here, (y) is the dependent variable, (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_p) are independent variables, (beta_0, beta_1, ldots, beta_p) are coefficients, and \(\epsilon\) is the error term.

### OLS Methodology
- **Objective of OLS:**
  - The goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, ensuring the best possible fit for the model to the observed data.
- **Computation:**
  - Unlike simple linear regression, closed-form solutions for the coefficients in MLR involve matrix operations, typically handled by software like Excel for computational efficiency.

### Practical Application: Hanumantha's Case Study
- **Background:**
  - Using data from Hanumantha's survey on customer spending, income, and household size, MLR analysis aims to improve understanding of spending behaviors.
- **Model Development:**
  - The model incorporates annual income and household size as predictors for monthly credit card spend.
- **Excel Implementation:**
  - Demonstrated using Excel's Analysis ToolPak, the session covers how to set up the regression analysis and interpret the output, including coefficients and their significance.

### Interpretation of Results
- **Coefficients:**
  - Each coefficient reflects the change in the dependent variable for one unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant.
- **Model Diagnostics:**
  - Discussion on evaluating the goodness-of-fit through \(R^2\) and the F-statistic, which assess the overall significance of the regression model.

### Conclusion
- **Summary:** MLR with OLS is a powerful tool that allows for more complex models that can better adjust to the nuances of real-world data, providing deeper insights into the factors that drive dependent variables.
- **Next Steps:** The course will continue to explore advanced regression techniques, enhancing the participants' abilities to conduct robust data analyses for strategic decision-making.
