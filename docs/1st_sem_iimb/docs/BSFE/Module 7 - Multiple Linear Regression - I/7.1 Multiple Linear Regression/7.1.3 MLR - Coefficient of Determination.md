# 7.1.3 MLR - Coefficient of Determination

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session delves into the coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) in the context of multiple linear regression, explaining its significance and how it is calculated.
- **Context:** Understanding \(R^2\) is essential for evaluating the explanatory power of a regression model involving multiple predictors.

### Explaining the Coefficient of Determination
- **Definition:** \(R^2\) measures the proportion of the total variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- **Formula:**
  - In multiple linear regression, \(R^2\) is still calculated as the ratio of the sum of squares due to regression (SSR) to the total sum of squares (SST): 
    \[
    R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SST}
    \]
  - SST represents the total variation around the mean of the dependent variable, while SSR indicates how much of that variation is explained by the model.

### Calculation in Multiple Linear Regression
- **Components:**
  - **SSR (Sum of Squares due to Regression):** Measures the explained variation by the regression model.
  - **SSE (Sum of Squares due to Error):** Measures the unexplained variation, which is the difference between SST and SSR.
- **Interpretation:** \(R^2\) values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a model with greater explanatory power.

### Application and Example
- **Practical Use:** Demonstrates how \(R^2\) is used to assess model fit in a scenario involving multiple predictors, such as annual income and household size, influencing a dependent variable like monthly spend.
- **Numerical Example:**
  - With \(SST = 114197923\), \(SSR = 91468852\), and \(SSE = 22729070\), the \(R^2\) is calculated as approximately 0.80, suggesting that 80% of the variability in monthly spend is explained by the model.

### Adjusted \(R^2\)
- **Purpose:** Adjusted \(R^2\) accounts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure of model fit, especially when the number of predictors is large.

### Conclusion
- **Significance:** \(R^2\) and Adjusted \(R^2\) are critical metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of a multiple regression model, helping to determine how well the model captures the dynamics of the data.
- **Next Steps:** The course will continue to explore deeper aspects of regression analysis, enhancing the participants' ability to handle complex models and derive insightful conclusions from their analyses.
