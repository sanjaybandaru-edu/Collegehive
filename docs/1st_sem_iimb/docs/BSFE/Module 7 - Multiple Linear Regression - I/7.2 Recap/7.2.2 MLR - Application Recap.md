# 7.2.2 MLR - Application Recap

### Overview
- **Objective:** Recapitulation of the application of multiple linear regression (MLR) using Hanumantha's dataset.
- **Context:** This session reviews the outcomes of applying MLR to predict monthly spending based on annual income and household size.

### Residual Analysis
- **Standardized Residuals:**
  - Most residuals fall within \(\pm 2\) standard deviations, suggesting normally distributed errors.
- **Residual Plots:**
  - No problematic patterns such as funnels or curvilinear shapes were observed, indicating no violations of homoscedasticity or independence assumptions.

### Conclusion
- **Implications for Business Decisions:**
  - The MLR model provides a robust framework for predicting monthly spending based on multiple economic factors, significantly improving upon simpler models.
- **Next Steps:**
  - The course will proceed to revisit examples from simple linear regression for comparison, enhancing understanding of the benefits of MLR.

### Discussion
- **Interactive Elements:**
  - The recap included active discussions with participants, such as Tejas and Ashwini, to contextualize the theoretical outcomes within practical business applications, enriching the learning experience.
