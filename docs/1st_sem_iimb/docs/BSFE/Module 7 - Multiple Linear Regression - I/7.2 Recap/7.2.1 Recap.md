# 7.2.1 Recap

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session reviews the key concepts of multiple linear regression (MLR) covered throughout the module, emphasizing their application using real-world data sets.
- **Context:** By revisiting these concepts, participants can reinforce their understanding and enhance their ability to apply MLR in varied business scenarios.

### Overview of MLR
- **Model Formulation:**
  - MLR seeks to establish a relationship between a single dependent variable (\(y\)) and multiple independent variables (\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p\)).
  - The regression model is expressed as:
    \[
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_px_p + \epsilon
    \]
  - Where \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p\) are the parameters estimated from the data, and \(\epsilon\) is the error term.

### Estimation Techniques
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):**
  - Utilized to estimate the regression coefficients by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSE), leading to the estimated regression equation:
    \[
    \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_px_p
    \]

### Significance Testing
- **F-test for Overall Significance:**
  - Tests if the model explains the variability in the dependent variable significantly better than the mean alone.
  - Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): \(\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \ldots = \beta_p = 0\)
  - An F-statistic and corresponding p-value determine if any of the independent variables have a statistically significant relationship with the dependent variable.

- **T-tests for Individual Coefficients:**
  - Assess the impact of each predictor independently.
  - Computes t-statistics for each coefficient to test the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): \(\beta_i = 0\) for each \(i\).

### Multicollinearity
- **Identification and Impact:**
  - Occurs when independent variables are highly correlated, potentially inflating standard errors and making it difficult to determine the effect of individual predictors.
  - Detected by high Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) or unexpected signs on coefficients.

### Residual Analysis
- **Assumption Validation:**
  - Residual plots are analyzed to check for homoscedasticity, normality, and independence.
  - Identification of outliers and influential observations to ensure the robustness of the model predictions.

### Conclusion
- **Summary:** Multiple Linear Regression provides a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships between a dependent variable and several independent variables.
- **Future Directions:**
  - Participants are encouraged to apply these techniques to more complex data sets, incorporating additional diagnostic checks and embracing more advanced regression methods to refine their predictive capabilities.
