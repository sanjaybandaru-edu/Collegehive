# 7.4.1 MLR - Intercept and OVB

### Introduction
- **Objective:** This session highlights the importance of the intercept in regression analysis and discusses omitted variable bias in the context of multiple linear regression.
- **Context:** Using practical examples, this session explains why the intercept and other variables are critical in understanding the full scope of regression models.

### Importance of the Intercept (b0)
- **Understanding the Intercept:**
  - The intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.
  - **Testing Hypothesis:** Often tested to see if it is significantly different from zero, though its importance may vary depending on the context and scope of the study.

### Omitted Variable Bias
- **Definition:** Omitted variable bias occurs when a relevant variable is left out of a model, leading to biased and inconsistent estimates of other coefficients.
- **Causes and Consequences:**
  - If omitted variables are correlated with both the dependent variable and one or more included independent variables, this can distort the estimated relationships.
  - Can lead to misleading conclusions about the effects of included variables.

### Detecting Omitted Variable Bias
- **Indicators of Bias:**
  - A significant change in the \(R^2\) value when additional variables are included in the model suggests omitted variables were important.
  - Changes in coefficient sizes and standard errors upon inclusion of new variables can also indicate previously omitted variable bias.

### Practical Example: Household Debt Analysis
- **Scenario:**
  - The example discusses a regression analysis where household debt is initially modeled as a function of first income. Additional variables like monthly payments and utilities are then included to observe the effect on \(R^2\) and regression coefficients.
- **Results:**
  - Initial model with only first income yielded an \(R^2\) of 0.31. Including monthly payments and utilities increased \(R^2\) to 0.71, suggesting significant omitted variable bias in the initial model.
  - Adjustments in coefficient estimates and standard errors were observed, confirming the bias was addressed by including more relevant variables.

### Conclusion
- **Summary:** Understanding the intercept and addressing omitted variable bias are crucial for accurate regression modeling. This session emphasizes careful model specification and the importance of including all relevant predictors to avoid misleading results.
- **Next Steps:** Further discussions will delve into advanced techniques for diagnosing and remedying model specification errors to enhance the reliability of regression analyses.
