## 3.5.2 Linear Combinations of Random Variables - II

**Key Concepts**

* **Linear Combination:** The process of forming a new random variable by summing or combining others with each multiplied by a coefficient.
* **Normal Distribution:** Emphasizes that linear combinations of normally distributed variables remain normally distributed.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Single Random Variable Combination**

* **Basic Formulation:** For a random variable X normally distributed with mean μ and variance σ^2, a new variable Y = aX + b is also normally distributed.
* **Expectation and Variance:**
    * E(Y) = aμ + b
    * Var(Y) = a^2σ^2

**Combining Two Independent Variables**

* **Variables:** X1 and X2 with means μ1, μ2 and variances σ1^2, σ2^2 respectively.
* **Resultant Distribution:**
    * If Y = X1 + X2, then E(Y) = μ1 + μ2 and Var(Y) = σ1^2 + σ2^2.

**General Case for Multiple Variables**

* **Variables:** X1, X2, ..., Xn with coefficients a1, a2, ..., an.
* **Linear Combination:** Y = a1X1 + a2X2 + ... + anXn + b.
* **Expectation and Variance:**
    * E(Y) = a1μ1 + a2μ2 + ... + anμn + b
    * Var(Y) = a1^2σ1^2 + a2^2σ2^2 + ... + an^2σn^2

**Special Cases:**

* If coefficients are equal and b = 0, Y is the sum of Xi's.
* If averaging, Y becomes the average with reduced variance.

**Practical Application**

* **Example Scenario:**
    * **Machining Tolerances:** Consider two machine parts with dimensions normally distributed. The gap between them can be modeled as a linear combination of their dimensions, which is also normally distributed. This can be used to assess fit probabilities and optimal functioning conditions.
    * **Finance and Investment:** In financial modeling, combining asset returns to evaluate overall investment performance or risk assessment.
