## 3.5.1 Linear Combinations of Random Variables - I

**Key Concepts**

* **Linear Combination:** A new random variable formed by summing multiple random variables each multiplied by a constant coefficient.
* **Normal Random Variables:** If the original random variables are normal and independent, the linear combination is also normally distributed.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Basic Definitions**

* **Random Variables:** Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be a sequence of random variables.
* **Constants:** Let a1, a2, ..., an be constants.
* **Linear Combination:** A new random variable Y is defined as 
    * Y = a1X1 + a2X2 + ... + anXn

**Expectation and Variance**

* **Expectation of Y:** The expectation is linear, so 
    * E(Y) = a1E(X1) + a2E(X2) + ... + anE(Xn)

* **Variance of Y:**
    * If Xi's are independent, 
        * Var(Y) = a1^2Var(X1) + a2^2Var(X2) + ... + an^2Var(Xn)

    * If Xi's are correlated, covariance terms are also included:
        * Var(Y) = ∑ a_i^2Var(X_i) + ∑_{i ≠ j} 2a_ia_jCov(X_i, X_j)

**Normal Distribution of Y**

* **Normality:** If Xi's are normal, Y is also normal. This holds regardless of whether Xi's are independent or correlated.
* **Importance:** This property is crucial because it simplifies the analysis of Y, allowing the use of normal distribution properties and methods.

**Practical Application**

* **Statistical Modeling:** Understanding how linear combinations work is vital in fields like econometrics and finance, where multiple normal variables (like errors in regression models) are combined.

**Example Calculation:**

* Consider X1 and X2 are normal random variables with means 10 and 20, variances 15 and 25, respectively, and they are independent. 
* Calculate E(Y) and Var(Y) for Y = 3X1 + 4X2.

    * E(Y) = 3 * 10 + 4 * 20 = 110
    * Var(Y) = 3^2 * 15 + 4^2 * 25 = 145 + 400 = 545
