## 3.4.3 Examples of Normal Distribution

**Key Concepts**

* **Normal Distribution:** Characterized by its bell-shaped curve, the normal distribution is defined by two parameters—mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).
* **Applications:** Used extensively in fields ranging from finance to science for modeling and predicting behaviors.

**Example 1: Investment Returns**

**Scenario:** Munaf Khan, a stock broker, analyzes returns on large-cap stock funds, which are normally distributed with a mean return of 12% and a standard deviation of 3%.

**Categories of Investment:**

* Excellent: Returns > 10%
* Moderate: Returns between 5% and 10%
* Unsatisfactory: Returns < 5%

**Probability Calculations:**

* Probability of unsatisfactory investment: Using the cumulative distribution function.
* Probability of an excellent investment: Calculating the tail probability for returns over 10%.

**Example 2: Screen Time Study**

**Scenario:** Dr. Bhavani Kapadia studies screen time among school children, which is normally distributed with a mean of 8.4 hours/day and a standard deviation of 2.5 hours/day.

**Questions:**

* Probability of screen time between 6 to 12 hours.
* Top and bottom 20% of screen time durations: Using inverse probability calculations to determine cutoff points.

**Example 3: Exam Duration**

**Scenario:** Professor Hirav Joshi from Maharaja Sayajirao University observes the duration students take to complete his exams, following a normal distribution with a mean of 150 minutes and a standard deviation of 20 minutes.

**Calculations:**

* Students completing within 2 hours.
* Duration between 2 to 3 hours.
* More than 3 hours duration.

**Using Excel for Normal Distribution:**

* **Implement NORM.DIST for direct probability calculations.**
* **Use NORM.INV for inverse calculations to find critical points.**
