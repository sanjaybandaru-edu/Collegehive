## 3.4.2 Standard Normal Distribution

**Overview**

This section focuses on the standard normal distribution, a special case of the normal distribution where the mean (μ) is 0 and the standard deviation (σ) is 1. This distribution is crucial in statistical analysis due to its role in simplifying calculations and understanding the properties of any normal distribution.

**Key Concepts**

* **Standard Normal Distribution:** Describes a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, often denoted as Z.
* **Critical Values (Z-Scores):** These are points on the Z scale corresponding to specified tail areas; critical values are used extensively in hypothesis testing and setting confidence intervals.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Properties of the Standard Normal Distribution**

* **Symmetry and Shape:** The distribution is perfectly symmetrical around zero, exhibiting a bell-shaped curve. The total area under the curve equals 1.
* **Z-Scores:** These scores measure the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean. A Z-score of 1.0 indicates a value one standard deviation above the mean.

**Critical Values and Their Use**

* **Definition:** Critical values (Z-scores) such as Zα/2 are used to determine the cutoff points on the standard normal curve for a given confidence level.
* **Examples of Critical Values:**
    * Z0.05 = 1.645 (used for 90% confidence level)
    * Z0.025 = 1.96 (used for 95% confidence level)
    * Z0.005 = 2.576 (used for 99% confidence level)

**Computational Methods**

* **Finding Probabilities:** Using standard normal tables or software functions like NORM.S.DIST in Excel to find the probability associated with specific Z-scores.
* **Inverse Calculations:** Using NORM.S.INV in Excel to find the Z-score corresponding to a given cumulative probability.

**Practical Application**

* **Statistical Inference:** Critical values from the standard normal distribution are used to determine whether to reject null hypotheses in significance testing.

**Example Calculations:**

* Finding the probability of Z < 1.645.
* Calculating the cumulative probability for Z = -1.96.
