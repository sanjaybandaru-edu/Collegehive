## 3.8.1 F - Distribution

**Key Concepts**

* **F-Distribution:** A ratio of two scaled chi-square distributions which are independent.
* **Degrees of Freedom:** Characterized by two parameters, k1 and k2, which are the degrees of freedom of the two chi-square distributions in the numerator and denominator, respectively.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Formation of the F-Distribution**

* If U and V are two independent chi-square random variables with k1 and k2 degrees of freedom respectively, then the random variable 
    * F = (U/k1) / (V/k2) 
    follows an F-distribution with k1 and k2 degrees of freedom.

**Properties of F-Distribution**

* **Skewness:** The distribution is not symmetric but skewed to the right, with the extent of skewness decreasing as k2 increases.
* **Mean and Variance:** The mean of the F-distribution is k2 / (k2 - 2) for k2 > 2, and its variance is more complex, generally increasing with k1 and decreasing as k2 increases.

**Applications**

* **ANOVA:** Used to compare the variances of three or more samples to find out if at least one sample mean differs significantly from the others.
* **Regression Analysis:** Assists in determining whether variables are significant predictors of an outcome.

**Practical Application**

**Example Calculation:**

* If you are testing the equality of variances across two independent samples where one sample has 10 degrees of freedom and the other has 20, you would use an F-distribution with k1 = 10 and k2 = 20.
