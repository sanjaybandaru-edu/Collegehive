# 3.2.1 Uniform Distribution

## Overview
This section explores the uniform random variable, characterized by equal likelihood of assuming any value within a specific range. We'll look at its probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and how these concepts are applied to calculate probabilities and other statistical measures.

## Key Concepts
- **Uniform Random Variable:** A random variable that can take any value between a specified lower (L) and upper limit (U) with equal probability.
- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** Constant across the interval [L, U] and zero elsewhere.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** Provides the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Definition and Characteristics
- **Uniform Distribution:** Defined by the probability being proportional to the length of the interval between L and U.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**

- **Diagram Recommended:** Show the flat shape of the PDF and the linear growth of the CDF within the interval.

### Expectation and Variance
- **Expectation (Mean):** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a4b015-a227-475d-b3fd-0c1c9b4279ca)

- **Variance:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b47b4a2-6f36-471b-a401-453347343375)

- **Example and Calculation:** Use a practical example, such as driving times, to calculate mean and variance.

### Practical Example
- **Context:** Nilesh Shah's driving time from Vadodara to Ahmedabad.
- **Application:**
  - Expected driving time based on uniform distribution.
  - Probabilities of driving times within specific intervals.
- **Calculations:**
  - Probability of driving time being less than 130 minutes.
  - Probability of driving time exceeding 105 minutes.
- **Special Note:** Highlight that the probability of any precise value, like exactly 120 minutes, is zero in continuous distributions.
