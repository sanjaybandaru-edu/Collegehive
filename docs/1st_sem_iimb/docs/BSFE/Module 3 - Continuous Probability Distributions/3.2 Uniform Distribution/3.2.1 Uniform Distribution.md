# 3.2 Uniform Distribution

## Overview
This section explores the uniform random variable, characterized by equal likelihood of assuming any value within a specific range. We'll look at its probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and how these concepts are applied to calculate probabilities and other statistical measures.

## Key Concepts
- **Uniform Random Variable:** A random variable that can take any value between a specified lower (L) and upper limit (U) with equal probability.
- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** Constant across the interval [L, U] and zero elsewhere.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** Provides the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Definition and Characteristics
- **Uniform Distribution:** Defined by the probability being proportional to the length of the interval between L and U.
- **Mathematical Formulation:**
  - **PDF:** f(x)=1U−Lf(x) = \frac{1}{U - L}f(x)=U−L1​ for xxx in [L, U], and f(x)=0f(x) = 0f(x)=0 otherwise.
  - **CDF:** F(x)=x−LU−LF(x) = \frac{x - L}{U - L}F(x)=U−Lx−L​ for xxx in [L, U].
- **Diagram Recommended:** Show the flat shape of the PDF and the linear growth of the CDF within the interval.

### Expectation and Variance
- **Expectation (Mean):** E(X)=L+U2E(X) = \frac{L + U}{2}E(X)=2L+U​.
- **Variance:** Var(X)=(U−L)212\text{Var}(X) = \frac{(U - L)^2}{12}Var(X)=12(U−L)2​.
- **Example and Calculation:** Use a practical example, such as driving times, to calculate mean and variance.

### Practical Example
- **Context:** Nilesh Shah's driving time from Vadodara to Ahmedabad.
- **Application:**
  - Expected driving time based on uniform distribution.
  - Probabilities of driving times within specific intervals.
- **Calculations:**
  - Probability of driving time being less than 130 minutes.
  - Probability of driving time exceeding 105 minutes.
- **Special Note:** Highlight that the probability of any precise value, like exactly 120 minutes, is zero in continuous distributions.
