## 3.2.2 Examples of Uniform Distribution

**Overview**

This section provides practical examples demonstrating how the uniform distribution can be applied in real-world scenarios, emphasizing its utility in modeling evenly distributed outcomes over a specific interval.

**Key Concepts**

* **Uniform Distribution in Real Life:** Showcases how to model various real-life situations with uniform random variables.
* **Probability Calculations:** Discusses how to compute probabilities for events within the defined uniform distribution interval.
* **Percentile Calculations:** Explains how to determine percentiles within the uniform distribution framework.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Example 1: Mobile Phone Battery Life**

**Context:** Meena Desai's new Samsung Galaxy phone battery life varies uniformly between 8 to 12 hours.

**Probabilities:**

* Probability of needing recharge in 9 hours or less: 
   * F(9) = (9 - 8) / (12 - 8) = 0.25 

* Probability of lasting at least 11 hours: 
   * F(11) = (12 - 11) / (12 - 8) = 0.25

**80th Percentile Calculation:**

The time by which 80% of the battery lives end before needing a recharge is 11.2 hours.

**Theoretical Discussion**

* **Definition of Percentiles for Random Variables:** Percentiles are calculated by setting the CDF equal to the desired percentile value.
* **Inverse Calculation of CDF:** Demonstrates the calculation process to find specific time points like the 80th percentile.

**Discrete vs. Continuous Uniform Distributions**

* **Comparison:** Highlights the similarities and differences between discrete and continuous uniform distributions.
* **Example of Discrete Uniform Distribution:** Discusses the distribution of outcomes when rolling a fair dieâ€”each outcome from 1 to 6 has an equal probability of 1/6.

**Practical Implications and Calculations**

* **Visualizations:**
    * **Diagram Recommended:** Graphs of PDF and CDF for the battery life example.
    * **Tabular Representation:** Display calculations for different probabilities and percentiles.

* **Discussion:** Emphasize the importance of understanding uniform distribution for modeling scenarios with evenly spaced outcomes and its implications in decision-making processes.
