## 3.7.1 Student's t Distribution

**Key Concepts**

* **t-Distribution:** A family of distributions that arise when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown.
* **Degrees of Freedom:** Related to the sample size; affects the shape of the distribution.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Formation of t-Distribution**

* A t-distribution arises when a standard normal variable Z is divided by the square root of a Chi-square variable X scaled by its degrees of freedom k: 
    * T = Z / sqrt(X/k)

* **Degrees of Freedom:** The parameter k in the Chi-square variable determines the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution.

**Properties of t-Distribution**

* **Mean and Variance:** The mean of the t-distribution is 0 (for k > 1), and its variance is k / (k-2) (for k > 2), making it wider and flatter than the normal distribution.
* **Shape:** Similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails, providing greater flexibility for analyzing data with outliers or small samples.
* **Convergence to Normality:** As k increases, the t-distribution converges to the normal distribution.

**Applications**

* **Hypothesis Testing:** Particularly useful for estimating means from small sample sizes, especially in student t-tests.
* **Confidence Intervals:** Used to calculate the confidence intervals for means when the sample size is small and the population variance is unknown.

**Practical Application**

**Example Calculation:**

* If you have a sample of size 10 from a normal distribution and need to test the hypothesis about the mean, you would use a t-distribution with 9 degrees of freedom to determine the test statistics and p-values.
