## 3.6.1 Chi-Square Distribution

**Key Concepts**

* **Chi-Square Distribution:** Derived from the square of a standard normal distribution, it is used extensively in hypothesis tests.
* **Degrees of Freedom:** Refers to the number of independent values in the data after accounting for any parameters estimated.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Definition and Formation**

* **Standard Normal Squared:** If Z is a standard normal random variable, Z^2 has a Chi-Square distribution with one degree of freedom.
* **Sum of Squares:** More generally, if Z1, Z2, ..., Zn are independent standard normal random variables, then 
    * X = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + ... + Z_n^2 
    has a Chi-Square distribution with n degrees of freedom.

**Properties of Chi-Square Distribution**

* **Skewness:** The distribution is skewed right, with skewness decreasing as degrees of freedom increase.
* **Mean and Variance:** The mean is equal to the degrees of freedom (n), and the variance is twice the degrees of freedom (2n).
* **Convergence to Normality:** As the degrees of freedom increase, the distribution approximates a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem.

**Applications**

* **Goodness of Fit Tests:** Used to determine if observed data deviates significantly from expected data.
* **Independence in Contingency Tables:** Tests whether two classifications are independent.
* **Variance Estimation:** Used in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparing sample variances.

**Practical Application**

**Example Calculation:**

* Consider n=10 where each Zi is standard normal. Then X follows a Chi-Square distribution with 10 degrees of freedom.

**Excel Computation:**

* Use CHISQ.DIST(x, k, TRUE) for the cumulative distribution function.
* Use CHISQ.DIST.RT(x, k) for the right-tail probability.
