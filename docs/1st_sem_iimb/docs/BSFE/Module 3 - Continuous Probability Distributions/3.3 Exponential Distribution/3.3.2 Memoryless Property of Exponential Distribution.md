## 3.3.2 Memoryless Property of Exponential Distribution

**Overview**

This section explores the unique memoryless property of the exponential distribution, a characteristic that sets it apart from most other probability distributions.

**Key Concepts**

* **Memoryless Property:** The property that the remaining time until an event occurs is independent of any time that has already passed.
* **Mathematical Formulation:** 
    * If X is an exponential random variable with rate λ, then for any s, t ≥ 0, 
        * P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t)

**Detailed Explanation**

**Definition and Explanation**

* **Exponential Random Variable:** Measures time until an event with a constant average rate λ, expressed as E(X) = 1/λ.
* **Memoryless Example:** Once a certain amount of time s has elapsed, the distribution of the remaining time until the event occurs is the same as the original distribution.

**Mathematical Derivation**

* **Conditional Probability:** Shows how the memoryless property mathematically simplifies conditional probability calculations.
* **Derivation:** For an exponential random variable X and s, t ≥ 0, the property is shown by:
    * P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > s + t) / P(X > s) = e^(-λ(s + t)) / e^(-λs) = e^(-λt) = P(X > t)

**Practical Example**

**Scenario:** Shanti's bus waiting times modeled as exponential with mean 20 minutes (λ = 0.05).

**Probability Calculations:**

* Less than 15 minutes: 1 - e^(-0.05 * 15) ≈ 0.528
* More than 30 minutes: e^(-0.05 * 30) ≈ 0.223
* Between 15 and 30 minutes: e^(-0.05 * 15) - e^(-0.05 * 30) ≈ 0.249

**Memoryless Demonstrations:**

* After waiting 10 minutes, probability of waiting another 10 minutes: e^(-0.05 * 10) ≈ 0.607
* After waiting 20 minutes, probability of waiting another 10 minutes remains 0.607, demonstrating the memoryless property.
