## 3.3.1 Exponential Distribution

**Overview**

This section delves into the exponential random variable, exploring its probability density function (PDF), key properties, and various real-world applications. The exponential distribution models the time between occurrences of random events with a constant average rate.

**Key Concepts**

* **Exponential Random Variable:** Measures the time between random events, taking only positive values.
* **Probability Density Function (PDF):** Defined by

    where λ is the rate of occurrence per unit time.
* **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** Given by

    representing the probability of an event occurring by a certain time x.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Properties of the Exponential Distribution**

* **Memorylessness:** The distribution's future probabilities are not affected by any knowledge of when the last event occurred, unique to the exponential distribution.
* **Mean and Variance:** Both are defined by λ, with the mean 
    * E(X) = 1 / λ 
    * Var(X) = 1 / λ^2

* **Skewness:** The distribution is right-skewed, indicating a longer tail to the right of the mean.

**Computational Formulas**

* Probability between two points (a and b):

* **Expectation and Variance Calculations:** Both integral and practical formulas highlight the simplicity and elegance of exponential distribution calculations.

**Applications**

* **Service Times:** Modeling call center wait times or repair times.
* **Lifetime Modeling:** Used for equipment and component life expectancy.
* **Queueing Theory:** Useful in predicting waiting times in queues.

**Practical Example**

**Scenario:** Megha Jain's wait times at a travel service desk.

**Mean Wait Time:** 2 minutes, implying λ = 0.5.

**Probability Queries:**

* Less than one minute:

* More than three minutes:

* Between one and three minutes: 
    * P(1 < X < 3) ≈ 0.383

* 90th percentile of waiting time: Approximately 4.605 minutes.
