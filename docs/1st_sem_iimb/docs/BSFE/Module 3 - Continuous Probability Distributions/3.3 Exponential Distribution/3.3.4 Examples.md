## 3.3.4 Examples

**Rohit's Garage Example**

**Scenario:** Rohit offers a discount if oil changes take longer than 20 minutes. He is interested in probabilities related to service times and the number of services completed.

**Service Time Analysis:**

* **Exponential Distribution:** Average service time of 20 minutes.

**Probability Calculations:**

* **Less than 20 minutes:** Uses cumulative probability function.
    * P(X < 20) = 1 - e^(-0.05 * 20) ≈ 0.632 (63% chance service is less than 20 minutes)

* **Between 15 and 30 minutes:** Difference between cumulative probabilities at these points.
    * P(15 < X < 30) = e^(-0.05 * 15) - e^(-0.05 * 30) ≈ 0.249 (24.9% chance service takes 15-30 minutes)

**Service Count Analysis**

* **Four-hour Shift:**
    * Expected number of oil changes: 12 (20 minutes each, so 3 per hour).
    * Probability of completing more than 15 oil changes modeled as Poisson with λ = 12.

* **Eight-hour Shift:**
    * Expected number of oil changes: 24.
    * Probability of completing more than 30 oil changes modeled as Poisson with λ = 24.

**Example Calculations**

* **Morning shift output:** P(Y > 15) with λ = 12 calculated using Poisson distribution.
* **Full day output:** P(Y > 30) with λ = 24 calculated using Poisson distribution.
