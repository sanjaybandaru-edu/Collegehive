# 5.2.2 Confidence Interval for Population Mean - ùúé Unknown

### Introduction
- **Overview:** Discusses the approach to estimating confidence intervals for the population mean when the population standard deviation (œÉ) is not known.
- **Context:** This is a common scenario in practical statistics, where precise information about the population's variability is lacking.

### Theoretical Background
- **Student T-Distribution:** Unlike scenarios where œÉ is known and the normal distribution can be used, the unknown œÉ scenario necessitates using the sample standard deviation (s) and the t-distribution.
- **Rationale:** The t-distribution is used because it accommodates the extra uncertainty introduced by estimating œÉ from the sample itself. This distribution becomes particularly relevant when sample sizes are small, providing a more accurate reflection of the uncertainty in the interval estimation.

### Confidence Interval Calculation
- **Formula:** The confidence interval for the population mean (Œº) when œÉ is unknown is calculated as:
  \[
  \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
  \]
  where:
  - \( \bar{x} \) is the sample mean.
  - \( t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \) is the critical value from the t-distribution for \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom.
  - \( s \) is the sample standard deviation.
  - \( n \) is the sample size.

### Practical Application
- **Scenario Example:** A business analyst might use this method to estimate the mean spending of customers when only a sample of transactions is available without prior knowledge of the overall spending variability.

### Advantages of Using the T-Distribution
- **Flexibility:** The t-distribution is more adaptable to situations with less information and smaller samples, making it ideal for preliminary studies or when high-cost data gathering is not feasible.
- **Behavior:** As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution, illustrating its suitability for a wide range of sample sizes.

### Conclusion
- **Summary:** When œÉ is unknown, the t-distribution provides a robust method for constructing confidence intervals, ensuring that estimates remain reliable despite the lack of complete information about the population's variability.
- **Next Steps:** Further modules will explore how these techniques can be applied to more complex statistical analyses and decision-making processes.
