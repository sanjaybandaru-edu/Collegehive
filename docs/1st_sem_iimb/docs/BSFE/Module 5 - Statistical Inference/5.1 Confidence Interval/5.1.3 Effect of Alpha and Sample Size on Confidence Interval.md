# 5.1.3 Effect of Alpha and Sample Size on Confidence Interval

### Introduction
- **Overview:** Examining how the confidence level (alpha) and sample size affect the width of confidence intervals in statistical analysis.

### Confidence Coefficient and Margin of Error
- **Impact of Confidence Coefficient:**
  - Increasing the confidence level from 80% to 99% increases the margin of error, making the confidence interval wider. This reflects higher certainty but reduces precision.
  - A 100% confidence level would theoretically require an infinite margin of error, rendering the interval useless.

### Optimal Confidence Coefficient
- **Application-Specific:**
  - The choice of confidence level depends on the stakes of being wrong. High-stakes scenarios (like FDA approvals) might require 95% or 99% confidence intervals.
  - In less critical contexts, a lower confidence level (e.g., 90%) might be acceptable if the cost of error is low.

### Influence of Sample Size
- **Sample Size Impact:**
  - The margin of error decreases inversely with the square root of the sample size. A larger sample size yields a smaller margin of error, enhancing the confidence interval's precision.
  - Determining the "optimal" sample size involves balancing the desired precision (small margin of error) against practical constraints like cost and feasibility.

### Practical Application
- **Decision Making:**
  - Consistency in choosing a confidence coefficient is crucial when comparing different decision options to ensure comparability.
  - The formula for margin of error is commonly used to calculate the necessary sample size to achieve a specific margin of error, balancing accuracy with resource constraints.

### Conclusion
- **Summary:** This module underscores the importance of selecting appropriate confidence levels and sample sizes in statistical inference to optimize decision-making processes based on the data collected.
