Managers need certain skills to do their job well, just like you need different skills for school, sports, or hobbies. Here are the key **managerial skills**:

## 1. **Technical Skills**
These are the specific skills a manager needs to understand the job their team is doing. For example, if you're managing a group project on history, you need to know enough about history to guide your team. In a company, technical skills might be about knowing how to use certain tools or software.

## 2. **People Skills (Human Skills)**
Managers need to be **good with people**. This means they can communicate well, listen to others, and work with different types of personalities. For example, if your group project team has a conflict, a manager helps everyone get along and solve the issue.

## 3. **Problem-Solving Skills**
Managers need to know how to **solve problems**. Things don’t always go as planned, and a manager has to think of solutions. This is like when your group project hits a roadblock, and you have to come up with a new plan to finish on time.

## 4. **Decision-Making Skills**
A big part of being a manager is **making decisions**. Sometimes the choice is tough, but managers have to decide the best way to move forward. It’s similar to deciding which option is best when your group has different ideas on how to do something.

## 5. **Time Management Skills**
Managers have to be **good at managing time**. They need to make sure tasks are completed on schedule, just like when you organize your homework or projects to meet deadlines without rushing at the last minute.

## 6. **Leadership Skills**
Managers need to know how to **lead a team**. This means motivating people, giving direction, and making sure everyone is working together towards a common goal. In your case, this could be like leading your friends in a game or a class project.

## 7. **Strategic Thinking Skills**
This is about being able to **think ahead** and plan for the future. A manager doesn’t just focus on what's happening today—they think about what’s coming next and prepare for it. This is like planning ahead for an exam or a big project so you’re not caught by surprise.

## Conclusion
In short, managers need a combination of **technical knowledge, people skills, problem-solving, leadership, and time management**. These skills help them guide their team to success, just like the skills you need to balance your schoolwork, friendships, and hobbies!
