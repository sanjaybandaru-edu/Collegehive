The **process of controlling** is all about making sure things are going according to plan and making adjustments when they aren’t. It’s like using a GPS for a trip—you set a destination, track your progress, and change directions if you get off course. Here’s how the process works step by step, explained in a simple way:

### 1. **Set Standards and Goals**
Before you can control anything, you need to know what you’re aiming for. This means setting clear standards or goals. Think of this like setting a target for yourself. For example:
- In school: You might set a goal of getting 85% on your next math test.
- In sports: Your team might aim to score 3 goals in the next game.

In business, these goals could be things like increasing sales, staying under a certain budget, or delivering products on time.

### 2. **Measure Actual Performance**
Once you’ve set your goal, you need to see how things are actually going. This means collecting data or information about what’s happening. In your daily life, it could be:
- Checking how well you’re doing on practice tests to see if you’re close to your 85% goal.
- Tracking how many goals your team has scored in a game.

For a business, this might involve checking sales numbers, customer feedback, or how much money they’re spending.

### 3. **Compare Actual Performance to Goals**
Next, you compare the results you’re getting with the goal you set. Did you score 85% on your math test, or did you score lower? Is your team meeting its goal of 3 goals in the game? 

In this step, you ask questions like:
- Are things going as planned?
- Are we on track to meet our goals?

This is the moment where you find out if you’re doing great or if something needs to change.

### 4. **Analyze Differences**
If your actual performance isn’t matching up with your goal, you need to figure out why. This is like asking, “What went wrong?” or “Why didn’t we meet our target?” For example:
- If you didn’t get 85% on your math test, maybe you didn’t study the right material.
- If your team didn’t score 3 goals, maybe your defense was weak or you didn’t practice enough.

In a business, this might mean figuring out why sales are down or why costs are too high.

### 5. **Take Corrective Action**
Once you’ve figured out what’s going wrong, it’s time to fix it. This is called "corrective action." It’s like adjusting your plan to make sure you get back on track. For example:
- If you didn’t do well on your math test, you might start studying more or ask for help from a tutor.
- If your team didn’t score enough goals, you might practice more before the next game or change your strategy.

In business, corrective action might mean launching a new marketing campaign, cutting costs, or improving customer service.

### 6. **Follow Up and Monitor**
Controlling doesn’t stop after one round of changes. You need to keep checking in to see if your actions worked. It’s like going back to step 2 and measuring performance again:
- Did studying more help you get better grades on your next test?
- Did your team improve its performance in the next game?

If things are still not going well, you may need to adjust your plan again. This process continues until you’re consistently meeting your goals.

### Summary of the Controlling Process:
1. **Set Goals**: Decide what you want to achieve (like getting a certain score or reaching a sales target).
2. **Measure Performance**: Check how things are actually going (like looking at test scores or sales data).
3. **Compare Results to Goals**: See if what’s happening matches what you planned.
4. **Analyze Differences**: If there’s a gap, figure out why it’s happening.
5. **Take Corrective Action**: Fix the problem by adjusting your plan.
6. **Follow Up**: Keep monitoring to make sure things stay on track.

This process is all about checking progress, fixing issues, and improving performance, whether in school, sports, or business.
