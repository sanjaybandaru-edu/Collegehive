Let me simplify the **steps in planning** for you. Think of these steps as a roadmap that managers follow to reach their goals, kind of like when you're planning a big event or project. Here’s a breakdown of each step:

## 1. **Establishing Objectives (Setting Goals)**
This is the first step, where you **decide what you want to achieve**. These are the goals that guide everything else. You also think about the conditions around you—both inside and outside the organization—before setting these goals. The objective should be clear about **what is to be done**, **who will do it**, and **when it needs to happen**.

**Example**: If you're planning a school event, your goal could be, "We want to organize a talent show by the end of the semester."

## 2. **Developing Premises (Making Assumptions)**
After setting goals, you need to think about the **conditions or assumptions** that will affect your plan. These assumptions might include things like how much money you’ll have, how many people will attend, and what the weather might be like. These are the factors that help you plan more realistically.

**Example**: You assume that 100 students will attend your talent show, and the school gym will be available on a specific date.

## 3. **Determining Alternative Courses (Exploring Options)**
Now, you come up with **different ways** to achieve your goal. There are usually several paths you can take, so it’s important to explore all your options.

**Example**: For your talent show, you might explore different venues (like the school gym or auditorium) or think about different themes for the show.

## 4. **Evaluating Alternative Courses (Weighing the Options)**
Once you have different options, you need to **evaluate** them by thinking about the pros and cons of each. This helps you figure out which option is the best based on your goals and the conditions around you.

**Example**: You compare the costs of using the gym vs. the auditorium and think about which one would work best for your talent show based on your budget and audience size.

## 5. **Selecting a Course of Action (Choosing the Best Plan)**
After evaluating all the options, it’s time to **choose the best plan**. This is the step where you make a decision about which path to take to reach your goal.

**Example**: You decide that holding the talent show in the gym is the best option because it’s cheaper and can hold all the students.

## 6. **Formulating Derivative Plans (Supporting Plans)**
Once the main plan is chosen, you create **additional plans** to support it. These are smaller plans for specific parts of the project. Each department or team in the organization might have its own detailed plan to ensure that the overall goal is achieved.

**Example**: For the talent show, you create a plan for the performers (getting auditions done), another for the decorations team, and another for managing the audience and tickets.

## 7. **Numberizing Plans by Budgeting (Creating Budgets)**
Next, you turn your plan into **numbers** by creating a budget. You figure out how much money you’ll need for the different parts of your plan. This step ensures that you don’t overspend and helps you keep track of income and expenses.

**Example**: You create a budget for the talent show, estimating costs for decorations, snacks, equipment, and rewards for the winners.

## 8. **Reviewing the Plans for Progress (Checking Progress)**
Finally, once the plan is being carried out, you need to **check** regularly to make sure everything is going smoothly. If something isn’t working as expected, you can adjust the plan to fix the problem. This ensures that you stay on track and meet your goals.

**Example**: While preparing for the talent show, you review the progress weekly, checking if decorations are ready and if all performers are set. If there’s an issue, like missing decorations, you make adjustments to get things back on track.
