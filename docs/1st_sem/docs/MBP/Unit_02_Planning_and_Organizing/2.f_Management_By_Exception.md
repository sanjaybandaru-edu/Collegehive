**Management by Exception (MBE)** is a style of management where managers focus only on **important issues** or **problems** that need their attention, instead of constantly checking in on every small detail. The idea is that managers step in when something is going wrong or when things aren’t going as expected, allowing them to save time and focus on the bigger picture.

## Here’s How It Works:

1. **Focus on Big Problems**: Instead of getting involved in every little task, managers let employees handle their work unless there's an issue. They only get involved when something **deviates from the plan**, like when a goal isn’t met or a problem arises.

   **Example**: In a school, the principal might not micromanage teachers day-to-day but will step in if test scores drop or if there’s a big issue with student behavior.

2. **Set Standards**: Before stepping back, managers set **standards or targets** for employees. These targets show what "normal" success looks like.

   **Example**: A sales manager might set a goal of selling 50 products a week. As long as the employees meet that goal, the manager doesn’t interfere.

3. **Intervene When Needed**: If things go wrong or employees fall below the set targets, managers step in to **fix the problem**. This way, they don’t waste time constantly checking every small detail when things are going fine.

   **Example**: If a salesperson only sells 30 products instead of 50, the manager will step in to find out what went wrong and how to improve.

4. **Empowers Employees**: MBE gives employees more **freedom** to do their jobs without constant supervision. They can make decisions on their own, and managers trust them to handle things unless something needs fixing.

## Why is Management by Exception Important?

- **Saves Time**: Managers focus their energy only on the **important issues**, not the minor ones, so they can spend more time on big decisions or strategic planning.
  
- **Empowers Employees**: It gives employees the freedom to manage their tasks on their own without someone constantly looking over their shoulder.

- **Improves Efficiency**: By focusing on what’s going wrong instead of what’s going right, MBE helps quickly identify problems and fix them before they get worse.

## Example:
Let’s say you’re running a lemonade stand with your friends. You tell them to make and sell 50 cups a day. You won’t bother checking in with them every hour if they’re doing fine, but if one day they only sell 20 cups, you step in to figure out what went wrong (maybe they ran out of lemons or didn’t set up the stand in the right spot).

## Summary:
**Management by Exception** is when managers let employees do their jobs and only step in when things aren’t going as planned. It helps managers save time by focusing on big problems, while also giving employees more freedom to do their work. It’s a smart way of managing because it ensures that managers are involved when needed, but not micromanaging every little thing!
