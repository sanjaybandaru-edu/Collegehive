Let’s break down the **levels of planning** based on four important factors: **time**, **level**, **broadness**, and **use**. This will help explain how each type of planning differs in its focus and purpose.

### 1. **Strategic Planning**
- **Time**: **Long-term** (typically 3 to 5 years, or even longer).
   - Example: Planning what career you want or where a company wants to be in 5 years.
  
- **Level**: **Top-level management** (the highest decision-makers, like CEOs or school principals).
   - Example: A principal planning the future vision for the school.

- **Broadness**: **Very broad** (big-picture thinking that involves major goals and directions).
   - Example: Deciding on what career path to pursue in life or what industry a company wants to dominate.

- **Use**: **Sets the overall direction** (provides a roadmap for where you want to go).
   - Example: You decide you want to become a doctor, or a company decides to expand into new markets.

### 2. **Tactical Planning**
- **Time**: **Mid-term** (usually from 6 months to 2 years).
   - Example: Planning what courses to take over the next few years to get into college.

- **Level**: **Middle-level management** (managers, department heads, or team leaders).
   - Example: A head of the science department planning next year's curriculum.

- **Broadness**: **More specific** than strategic planning (but still not super detailed).
   - Example: Choosing which classes you’ll need to take to fulfill your dream of becoming a doctor, or a company figuring out how to market a new product.

- **Use**: **Breaks down the strategic plan into specific steps** (how to achieve the big goal).
   - Example: Deciding which advanced classes you need to take, or a business working on marketing campaigns to support the expansion plan.

### 3. **Operational Planning**
- **Time**: **Short-term** (day-to-day, weekly, monthly, or up to a year).
   - Example: Making a weekly study schedule or planning your daily routine.

- **Level**: **Lower-level management** (supervisors or team members working on the ground).
   - Example: A teacher creating a daily lesson plan.

- **Broadness**: **Very specific and detailed** (focuses on day-to-day actions and tasks).
   - Example: Planning how much time you’ll spend on each subject tonight, or a company planning production shifts.

- **Use**: **Executes the tactical plan** (focuses on making sure things get done on time and correctly).
   - Example: Studying two hours of math every day for a week to prepare for a test, or a company making sure enough products are produced each day to meet the sales goals.

### Summary of Planning Levels Based on Time, Level, Broadness, and Use:

| **Type of Planning** | **Time Frame** | **Level** | **Broadness** | **Use** |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Strategic Planning** | Long-term (3-5 years or more) | Top-level management (CEOs, Principals) | Very broad | Sets overall goals and direction |
| **Tactical Planning** | Mid-term (6 months - 2 years) | Middle-level management (Department heads, Managers) | More specific | Breaks down the strategic plan into steps |
| **Operational Planning** | Short-term (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) | Lower-level management (Supervisors, Team leaders) | Very detailed | Executes the tactical plan, handles day-to-day tasks |

Each type of planning is important and builds on the other: **Strategic** sets the big goals, **Tactical** figures out how to achieve them, and **Operational** makes sure the daily tasks get done to keep things moving in the right direction.
