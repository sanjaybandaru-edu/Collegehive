## Key Aspects of Organizational Culture

1. **Shared Values**: These are the fundamental beliefs or guiding principles that are embraced by the organization. They determine what is considered important, such as innovation, customer service, teamwork, or sustainability. Shared values drive decision-making and set the tone for organizational priorities.

2. **Norms and Expectations**: Norms are the unwritten rules that guide behavior within the organization. They reflect what is acceptable or unacceptable conduct, influencing how employees communicate, collaborate, and approach their tasks. For example, norms might dictate whether employees feel comfortable sharing ideas freely or whether they should follow a hierarchical structure in decision-making.

3. **Symbols and Artifacts**: Symbols include logos, office design, dress codes, and rituals that visually and physically represent the organization’s culture. These artifacts serve as reminders of the organization’s values and can influence the way employees feel about their work environment.

4. **Language and Communication**: The way people communicate within the organization is a reflection of its culture. This includes formal communication channels, such as meetings and memos, as well as informal communication, such as social interactions among colleagues. The language used in these exchanges often reflects the organization’s priorities and values.

5. **Leadership and Management Style**: Leadership plays a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing organizational culture. The behavior of leaders, how they make decisions, and how they treat employees can strongly influence the overall work environment. Leaders are often seen as role models who embody the organization's culture.

6. **Work Environment and Practices**: Organizational culture is also expressed in the daily routines, procedures, and practices within the workplace. These practices may include how flexible work arrangements are, how performance is measured and rewarded, and how teams are structured and managed.
