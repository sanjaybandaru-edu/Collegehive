## Definition of Group

A group consists of two or more individuals who interact and are interdependent, coming together to achieve specific objectives.

Groups can be classified into two main types:

- **Formal Groups**: Defined by the organization’s structure with specific work assignments directed toward organizational goals.
- **Informal Groups**: Natural formations that arise out of social interactions, not formally structured or determined by the organization.

The relationship between formal and informal groups can be mutually reinforcing or competing. Informal groups can help formal groups solve complex problems.

## Types of Groups

### 1. **Formal Groups**

Formal groups are defined by the organization’s structure and have clearly designated roles and tasks. These groups are directed toward fulfilling organizational goals.

#### Types of Formal Groups:

- **Command Group**: Specified by the organizational chart, this group consists of a supervisor and their subordinates. For example, a foreman and their team of workers.
- **Temporary Task Group**: Formed to complete a specific task or project, often with members from different departments. An example would be a task force created to address a particular organizational problem.

### 2. **Informal Groups**

Informal groups are not structured or organizationally determined. They develop naturally out of social interactions, often within or across formal groups. These groups are also referred to as cliques.

#### Types of Informal Groups:

- **Horizontal Clique**: Made up of employees of similar rank from the same work area.
- **Vertical Clique**: Includes employees from different hierarchical levels within the same department.
- **Random Clique**: Comprises employees from different departments, locations, or hierarchical levels.

## Interacting, Co-acting, and Counteracting Groups

Based on the type of interactions that occur within groups, they can be categorized into:

- **Interacting Groups**: The work of one group member depends on the contributions of others. An example is an assembly line where workers perform separate operations in a prescribed sequence.
  
- **Co-acting Groups**: The work of each group member is independent of others. An example is a job-shop operation where individuals work separately.

- **Counteracting Groups**: These groups interact to reconcile differences, such as labor-management negotiation teams.

## Open and Closed Groups

Another way to classify groups is by their openness to change:

### Open Groups
- Characterized by constant change, with members frequently joining or leaving.
- They have a broad frame of reference due to high turnover, which can enhance creativity.
- Their time perspective is usually short-term, and they are more susceptible to instability.

### Closed Groups
- Have a stable membership with few changes over time.
- The stability often results in a narrow frame of reference and a longer time perspective.
- Closed groups are more balanced and stable compared to open groups.

1. **Problem-solving teams**
2. **Self-managed work teams**
3. **Cross-functional teams**
4. **Virtual teams**

## Properties of a Group

### 1. **Norms**
Norms are acceptable standards of behavior within a group that are shared by its members. They define the behaviors necessary for the group to reach its goals. Norms can include performance standards, dress codes, and rules about social interactions or resource allocation.

### 2. **Conformity**
Conformity refers to the adjustment of behavior to align with the group’s norms. There are two types of conformity:
- **Compliance**: When behavior reflects the group’s norms due to real or imagined pressure.
- **Personal Acceptance**: When individuals genuinely support and align their behavior with the group’s norms and goals.

### 3. **Roles**
Roles are a set of expected behavior patterns attributed to someone occupying a particular position in the group. This includes:
- **Role Perception**: How an individual believes they should behave in a situation.
- **Role Expectation**: How others believe a person should act.
- **Role Conflict**: Occurs when there are divergent role expectations.

### 4. **Diversity**
Diversity refers to the extent to which members of a group differ from or are similar to each other. While diversity can lead to conflicts, it also encourages creative problem-solving if managed well.

### 5. **Status**
Status is a socially defined position or rank given to group members. Higher-status individuals often have more freedom to deviate from group norms and resist conformity pressures.

### 6. **Cohesiveness**
Cohesiveness refers to how attracted group members are to one another and their motivation to stay in the group. Cohesiveness can enhance group productivity if the group’s performance norms are high.

## Social Identity Theory

Social identity theory suggests that people have emotional reactions to the successes or failures of their group because their self-esteem is tied to group performance. Social identity helps individuals reduce uncertainty about who they are and what they should do.

- **Ingroup Favoritism**: The tendency to see members of one’s own group as better than others and view outsiders as homogeneous.

Key factors that strengthen social identity include:
- **Similarity**
- **Distinctiveness**
- **Status**
- **Uncertainty Reduction**
