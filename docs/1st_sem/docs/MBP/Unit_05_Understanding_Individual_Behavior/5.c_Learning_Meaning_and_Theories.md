**Learning** can be understood as a relatively permanent change in an individual's potential behavior that arises from experiences or practice. This change may not immediately manifest as a visible behavior but instead reflects a readiness or capability to exhibit new behaviors in appropriate situations.

## Key Components of the Definition:
1. **Relatively Permanent Change**: Learning is not a fleeting change; it signifies a long-term modification in behavior potential. Although the change may not be permanent for life, it is more enduring than temporary adjustments like reflexive or instinctive behaviors.
   
2. **Behavioral Potentiality**: Learning refers to the *potential* for behavior to change. The learned behavior might not be immediately observable but can be demonstrated when the right conditions are present.

3. **Reinforced Practice or Experience**: Learning happens through exposure to new experiences or repeated practice. The term "reinforced" indicates that learning is solidified through rewards or meaningful outcomes that strengthen the connection between the behavior and its context.
