Cognitive learning theory, as proposed by **Edward Tolman** and **Wolfgang Köhler**, emphasizes that learning is not merely a result of mechanical responses to stimuli (as in conditioning theories), but rather an outcome of **deliberate thinking**. In cognitive learning, individuals actively process information by thinking through a problem or situation and using known facts to arrive at a **goal-oriented response**.

## Key Concepts of Cognitive Learning:
- **Cognition**: Refers to an individual's thoughts, knowledge, ideas, and understanding about themselves and their environment. Cognitive learning focuses on how people **organize, store, and retrieve information** to solve problems and make decisions.
- **Cognitive Structure**: Cognitive theorists argue that learners form mental structures that help them understand and organize information. This structure preserves information about various events and processes that occur during learning.

### Importance of Cognitive Learning:
In this theory, learning is not seen as a passive activity but as an **active mental process** where individuals engage with their environment, think critically about problems, and form strategies based on their understanding.

## Tolman’s Experiment with Rats: Cognitive Maps

One of Tolman's famous experiments involved placing rats in a **complicated maze** to see how they would learn to reach their goal of obtaining food. The results of this experiment led to the idea of **cognitive maps** and **expectancies**.

### Experiment Process:
1. **Learning Through Exploration**: The rats were placed in a maze with food at the end, and they had to navigate through the maze to reach the food. During this process, they were confronted with various choice points where they had to make decisions about which path to take.
   
2. **Formation of Expectations**: As the rats explored the maze, they began to develop **expectations** about certain paths and cues within the environment. At each choice point, they expected that a specific cue (such as a landmark in the maze) would lead them closer to their goal of finding the food.

3. **Strengthening Associations**: When the rats successfully reached the food, the association between the cue (choice point) and their expectation (reaching the food) was strengthened. In other words, they learned which cognitive cues were reliable indicators that they were on the right path toward their goal.

### Conclusion: Cognitive Map
Tolman concluded that the rats had developed a **cognitive map**—a mental representation of the maze—that allowed them to navigate efficiently to find the food. This cognitive map helped them understand the layout of the maze and remember which paths led to the goal, even in the absence of immediate reinforcement.

This experiment shows that the **organism’s actions** (in this case, the rat's behavior) are based on retrieving the **cognitive structure** or mental map formed during the learning process. This cognitive map is key to understanding how organisms can learn complex tasks by mentally representing their environment and anticipating outcomes based on past experiences.

## Summary of Cognitive Learning:
1. **Active Learning Process**: Unlike simple stimulus-response learning, cognitive learning involves active thinking and problem-solving. Learners use their knowledge and experience to form mental strategies.
   
2. **Mental Representations**: Learners create cognitive structures, like **cognitive maps**, that help them organize and retrieve information about their environment and experiences.
   
3. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Learning is aimed at achieving specific goals. The learner thinks about how to achieve these goals based on their understanding and experience.
   
4. **Role of Expectancy**: Learners develop expectations based on their interactions with the environment. If these expectations are confirmed (e.g., the rat finds the food), learning is strengthened.

Cognitive learning theory highlights that learning is not just about responding to stimuli but involves complex mental processes like thinking, organizing information, and making decisions that guide behavior toward achieving goals.
