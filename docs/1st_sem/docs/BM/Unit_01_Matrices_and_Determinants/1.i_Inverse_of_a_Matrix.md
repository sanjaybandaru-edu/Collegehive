# Inverse of a Matrix (Simple Problems Only)

## Definition
The **inverse of a matrix** is a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity matrix. Not all matrices have an inverse; a matrix must be **square** (having the same number of rows and columns) and have a **non-zero determinant** to have an inverse.

If \( A \) is a square matrix, then its inverse, denoted as \( A^{-1} \), satisfies the following equation:
\[
A \cdot A^{-1} = A^{-1} \cdot A = I
\]
Where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

### Conditions for Invertibility:
- The matrix must be square (i.e., it has the same number of rows and columns).
- The determinant of the matrix must be non-zero (\( \text{det}(A) \neq 0 \)).

The inverse of a 2x2 matrix can be calculated using a simple formula.

## Formula for the Inverse of a 2x2 Matrix

Given a 2x2 matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}
\]
The inverse of \( A \), if it exists, is given by:
\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix}
\]
Where \( \text{det}(A) = ad - bc \) is the determinant of the matrix.

The inverse exists only if \( \text{det}(A) \neq 0 \).

## Example 1: Finding the Inverse of a 2x2 Matrix

Let \( A \) be the following matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 7 \\ 2 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Determinant
First, find the determinant of matrix \( A \):
\[
\text{det}(A) = (4 \cdot 6) - (7 \cdot 2) = 24 - 14 = 10
\]

Since \( \text{det}(A) = 10 \neq 0 \), the matrix is invertible.

### Step 2: Apply the Inverse Formula
Now, apply the formula to find the inverse of \( A \):
\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{10} \begin{bmatrix} 6 & -7 \\ -2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Inverse
Multiply each element by \( \frac{1}{10} \):
\[
A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & -0.7 \\ -0.2 & 0.4 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Thus, the inverse of matrix \( A \) is:
\[
A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & -0.7 \\ -0.2 & 0.4 \end{bmatrix}
\]

## Example 2: Finding the Inverse of Another 2x2 Matrix

Let \( B \) be the following matrix:
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Determinant
First, find the determinant of matrix \( B \):
\[
\text{det}(B) = (1 \cdot 4) - (2 \cdot 3) = 4 - 6 = -2
\]

Since \( \text{det}(B) = -2 \neq 0 \), the matrix is invertible.

### Step 2: Apply the Inverse Formula
Now, apply the formula to find the inverse of \( B \):
\[
B^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2} \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ -3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Inverse
Multiply each element by \( \frac{1}{-2} \):
\[
B^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 \\ 1.5 & -0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Thus, the inverse of matrix \( B \) is:
\[
B^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 \\ 1.5 & -0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

## Conclusion
- The **inverse of a matrix** can be found only if the matrix is square and has a non-zero determinant.
- The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is easily calculated using the formula involving the determinant and a rearrangement of the matrix elements.
- If the determinant of a matrix is zero, the matrix does not have an inverse, and it is called **singular**.

Finding the inverse of a matrix is crucial in solving systems of linear equations, transforming matrices, and performing other operations in linear algebra.
