# Determinants and Properties


## Definition
The **determinant** is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. Determinants have important applications in linear algebra, including solving systems of linear equations, finding the inverse of a matrix, and determining whether a matrix is invertible. The determinant of a matrix is denoted as **det(A)** or \(\lvert A \rvert\), where \( A \) is a square matrix.

For example, for a 2x2 matrix \( A \):
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}
\]
The determinant of \( A \) is calculated as:
\[
\text{det}(A) = ad - bc
\]

# Properties of Determinants (Statements Only)

1. **Determinant of a Product**: The determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their determinants.
   \[
   \text{det}(A \cdot B) = \text{det}(A) \cdot \text{det}(B)
   \]

2. **Determinant of a Transpose**: The determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose.
   \[
   \text{det}(A^T) = \text{det}(A)
   \]

3. **Determinant of an Inverse**: The determinant of the inverse of a matrix (if it exists) is the reciprocal of the determinant of the original matrix.
   \[
   \text{det}(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)}
   \]

4. **Determinant of a Scalar Multiple**: If a matrix is multiplied by a scalar \( k \), the determinant of the matrix is multiplied by \( k^n \), where \( n \) is the size of the matrix.
   \[
   \text{det}(kA) = k^n \cdot \text{det}(A)
   \]
   For a 2x2 matrix, \( \text{det}(kA) = k^2 \cdot \text{det}(A) \).

5. **Determinant of an Identity Matrix**: The determinant of an identity matrix is always 1.
   \[
   \text{det}(I) = 1
   \]

6. **Row Interchange**: Swapping two rows (or columns) of a matrix changes the sign of the determinant.
   \[
   \text{det}(B) = -\text{det}(A) \quad \text{(where \( B \) is obtained by swapping rows of \( A \))}
   \]

7. **Zero Row or Column**: If a matrix has a row or column of all zeros, its determinant is zero.
   \[
   \text{det}(A) = 0
   \]

8. **Linearity of Determinants**: The determinant is linear in each row. This means if you scale one row of the matrix by a scalar, the determinant is scaled by the same scalar.

# Examples

### Example 1: Determinant of a 2x2 Matrix
Let \( A \) be a 2x2 matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of \( A \) is calculated as:
\[
\text{det}(A) = (3 \cdot 4) - (2 \cdot 1) = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

Thus, \( \text{det}(A) = 10 \).

### Example 2: Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix
Let \( B \) be a 3x3 matrix:
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\ -1 & 3 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix is calculated using cofactor expansion along the first row:
\[
\text{det}(B) = 1 \cdot \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} - 0 \cdot \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + 2 \cdot \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Calculating the 2x2 minors:
\[
\text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = (3 \cdot 0) - (1 \cdot 1) = -1
\]
\[
\text{det}\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = (-1 \cdot 1) - (3 \cdot 2) = -1 - 6 = -7
\]

Now, substitute these values into the cofactor expansion:
\[
\text{det}(B) = 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 + 2 \cdot (-7) = -1 + 0 - 14 = -15
\]

Thus, \( \text{det}(B) = -15 \).

## Conclusion
Determinants provide important information about matrices, such as whether a matrix is invertible. Understanding the properties of determinants allows us to simplify complex matrix operations, such as solving systems of linear equations, matrix inversion, and understanding matrix behavior under transformation.
