# Differentiation of Parametric Functions

Differentiation of parametric functions involves finding the derivative of a function that is defined in terms of a parameter, rather than as an explicit function of \(x\). In parametric differentiation, the coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) are given as functions of a third variable, typically \(t\), called the parameter.

If \(x\) and \(y\) are given as:
\[
x = f(t) \quad \text{and} \quad y = g(t),
\]
where both \(x\) and \(y\) are expressed in terms of the parameter \(t\), then the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\), denoted as \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), can be found using the following steps:

## Formula for Parametric Differentiation
To differentiate parametric functions, use the formula:
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}},
\]
where:
- \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) is the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(t\).
- \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) is the derivative of \(x\) with respect to \(t\).

## Steps for Differentiating Parametric Functions

1. **Differentiate \(x\) with respect to \(t\):** Find \(\frac{dx}{dt}\).
2. **Differentiate \(y\) with respect to \(t\):** Find \(\frac{dy}{dt}\).
3. **Divide \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) by \(\frac{dx}{dt}\):** This gives \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\).

## Example 1: Parametric Differentiation
Given the parametric equations:
\[
x = t^2 + 2t, \quad y = 3t - 4,
\]
find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).

1. **Differentiate \(x\) with respect to \(t\):**
   \[
   \frac{dx}{dt} = 2t + 2.
   \]

2. **Differentiate \(y\) with respect to \(t\):**
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dt} = 3.
   \]

3. **Divide \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) by \(\frac{dx}{dt}\):**
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3}{2t + 2}.
   \]

## Example 2: Finding the Second Derivative
To find the second derivative \(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\), first find the derivative of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) with respect to \(t\) and then divide by \(\frac{dx}{dt}\):
\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)}{\frac{dx}{dt}}.
\]

Using the previous example:
1. **Differentiate \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3}{2t + 2}\) with respect to \(t\):**
   \[
   \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{3}{2t + 2}\right) = \frac{-6}{(2t + 2)^2}.
   \]

2. **Divide by \(\frac{dx}{dt}\):**
   \[
   \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{\frac{-6}{(2t + 2)^2}}{2t + 2} = \frac{-6}{(2t + 2)^3}.
   \]

## Example 3: Parametric Equations Involving Trigonometric Functions
Given:
\[
x = \cos(t), \quad y = \sin(t),
\]
find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).

1. **Differentiate \(x\) with respect to \(t\):**
   \[
   \frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin(t).
   \]

2. **Differentiate \(y\) with respect to \(t\):**
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dt} = \cos(t).
   \]

3. **Divide \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) by \(\frac{dx}{dt}\):**
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\cos(t)}{-\sin(t)} = -\cot(t).
   \]

Parametric differentiation is especially useful in physics and engineering, where variables are often described in terms of a parameter, such as time. This method allows for analyzing the rate of change and curvature of parametric curves.
