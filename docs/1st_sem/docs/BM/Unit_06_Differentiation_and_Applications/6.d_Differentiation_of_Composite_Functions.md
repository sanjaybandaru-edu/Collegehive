# Differentiation of Composite Functions

Differentiation of composite functions is achieved using the **Chain Rule**, which allows you to differentiate a function that is composed of two or more functions. If you have a function within another function, the Chain Rule helps find the derivative of the overall composite function.

## Chain Rule Explanation
- The Chain Rule states that if a function \( y = f(g(x)) \), where \( f \) and \( g \) are functions of \( x \), then the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is given by:
  
  \[
  \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
  \]

  Here:
  - \( f'(g(x)) \) is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function.
  - \( g'(x) \) is the derivative of the inner function.

## Steps for Differentiating Composite Functions

1. **Identify the Inner and Outer Functions:**
   - The inner function is the one inside another function, i.e., \( g(x) \).
   - The outer function is the one that wraps around the inner function, i.e., \( f \).

2. **Differentiate the Outer Function:** 
   - Take the derivative of the outer function, leaving the inner function unchanged.
   - This gives you \( f'(g(x)) \).

3. **Differentiate the Inner Function:**
   - Now, differentiate the inner function \( g(x) \) to get \( g'(x) \).

4. **Multiply the Two Derivatives:**
   - Multiply the derivative of the outer function by the derivative of the inner function to get the final result: \( f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \).

## Example 1: Differentiating \( y = (3x + 2)^4 \)

- **Step 1:** Identify the inner function and the outer function.
  - Inner function, \( g(x) = 3x + 2 \)
  - Outer function, \( f(u) = u^4 \), where \( u = g(x) \)

- **Step 2:** Differentiate the outer function with respect to \( u \):
  - \( f'(u) = 4u^3 \)

- **Step 3:** Differentiate the inner function with respect to \( x \):
  - \( g'(x) = 3 \)

- **Step 4:** Apply the Chain Rule:
  \[
  \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = 4(3x + 2)^3 \cdot 3 = 12(3x + 2)^3
  \]

## Example 2: Differentiating \( y = \sin(5x^2) \)

- **Step 1:** Identify the inner and outer functions.
  - Inner function, \( g(x) = 5x^2 \)
  - Outer function, \( f(u) = \sin(u) \), where \( u = g(x) \)

- **Step 2:** Differentiate the outer function:
  - \( f'(u) = \cos(u) \)

- **Step 3:** Differentiate the inner function:
  - \( g'(x) = 10x \)

- **Step 4:** Apply the Chain Rule:
  \[
  \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = \cos(5x^2) \cdot 10x = 10x \cos(5x^2)
  \]

## Example 3: Differentiating \( y = e^{\cos(x)} \)

- **Step 1:** Identify the inner and outer functions.
  - Inner function, \( g(x) = \cos(x) \)
  - Outer function, \( f(u) = e^u \), where \( u = g(x) \)

- **Step 2:** Differentiate the outer function:
  - \( f'(u) = e^u \)

- **Step 3:** Differentiate the inner function:
  - \( g'(x) = -\sin(x) \)

- **Step 4:** Apply the Chain Rule:
  \[
  \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = e^{\cos(x)} \cdot (-\sin(x)) = -\sin(x) e^{\cos(x)}
  \]

The Chain Rule simplifies the process of differentiating composite functions by breaking them down into manageable parts. This method is essential when dealing with nested functions in calculus.
