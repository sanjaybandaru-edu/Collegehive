# Methods of Differentiation in BBA Mathematics

Differentiation in BBA mathematics involves finding the derivative of a function, which represents how the function changes with respect to its variable. Below are the key methods of differentiation:

## 1. Basic Differentiation Rules
- These include applying standard rules such as the constant rule, power rule, and constant multiple rule:
  - **Constant Rule:** The derivative of a constant is zero.
  - **Power Rule:** \( \frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n \cdot x^{n-1} \).
  - **Constant Multiple Rule:** \( \frac{d}{dx}(c \cdot f(x)) = c \cdot f'(x) \), where \( c \) is a constant.

## 2. Sum and Difference Rule
- When differentiating a function that is the sum or difference of two or more functions, differentiate each term separately.
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx}(f(x) \pm g(x)) = f'(x) \pm g'(x)
  \]

## 3. Product Rule
- Used when differentiating the product of two functions.
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx}(f(x) \cdot g(x)) = f(x) \cdot g'(x) + g(x) \cdot f'(x)
  \]
- This ensures that both functions are accounted for in the derivative.

## 4. Quotient Rule
- Applied when differentiating a quotient of two functions.
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{g(x) \cdot f'(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
  \]
- This is useful for differentiating fractions where one function is divided by another.

## 5. Chain Rule
- Used for finding the derivative of a composite function (a function within another function).
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
  \]
- The chain rule is helpful for differentiating functions with nested expressions.

## 6. Implicit Differentiation
- When a function is not explicitly solved for one variable in terms of another (e.g., \(x\) and \(y\) are mixed), implicit differentiation is used.
- Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\), applying the chain rule as needed.
- Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \).

## 7. Logarithmic Differentiation
- This method involves taking the natural logarithm of both sides of a function before differentiating.
- Useful for differentiating functions where the variable appears as both the base and exponent (e.g., \( y = x^x \)).
- **Steps:**
  1. Take the natural log of both sides: \( \ln(y) = \ln(f(x)) \).
  2. Differentiate both sides using the chain rule: \( \frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) \).
  3. Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \).

## 8. Higher-Order Derivatives
- These involve differentiating a function multiple times.
- The second derivative, \( f''(x) \), represents the derivative of the first derivative and measures the rate of change of the slope.
- Higher-order derivatives can be found by repeatedly applying differentiation.

## 9. Differentiation of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
- For exponential functions \( f(x) = e^x \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = e^x \).
- For logarithmic functions \( f(x) = \ln(x) \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} \).

## 10. Differentiation of Trigonometric Functions
- Common derivatives for trigonometric functions include:
  - \( \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) = \cos(x) \)
  - \( \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(x)) = -\sin(x) \)
  - \( \frac{d}{dx}(\tan(x)) = \sec^2(x) \)

These methods provide a range of techniques for solving problems related to rates of change, optimization, and other calculus-based applications in business administration.
