# 7.g Present Value

## Introduction

The present value (PV) is the current worth of a sum of money to be received or paid in the future, discounted at a specific interest rate. It helps determine how much a future amount is worth in today's terms. The concept of present value is fundamental in finance and investment, as it accounts for the time value of money â€“ the idea that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.

### 1. Present Value with Simple Interest

The formula to calculate present value when simple interest is used is:

\[
PV = \frac{A}{1 + (R \times T)}
\]

Where:
- \( PV \) = Present value
- \( A \) = Accumulated future amount
- \( R \) = Annual interest rate (decimal form)
- \( T \) = Time period (in years)

### 2. Present Value with Compound Interest

The formula to calculate present value when compound interest is used is:

\[
PV = \frac{A}{\left(1 + \frac{R}{n}\right)^{n \times T}}
\]

Where:
- \( PV \) = Present value
- \( A \) = Accumulated future amount
- \( R \) = Annual interest rate (decimal form)
- \( n \) = Number of compounding periods per year
- \( T \) = Time period (in years)

## Example 1: Calculating Present Value with Simple Interest

### Problem
You want to know the present value of $5,000 that you will receive in 3 years if the interest rate is 6% per annum with simple interest.

### Solution
Given:
- \( A = 5000 \) (Future amount)
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \) (Annual interest rate)
- \( T = 3 \) years (Time period)

Using the present value formula for simple interest:

\[
PV = \frac{5000}{1 + (0.06 \times 3)}
\]

\[
PV = \frac{5000}{1 + 0.18}
\]

\[
PV = \frac{5000}{1.18} \approx 4237.29
\]

### Explanation
The present value of $5,000 to be received in 3 years, at a 6% simple interest rate, is approximately $4,237.29. This means that $4,237.29 today is equivalent to $5,000 in 3 years if the annual interest rate is 6%.

## Example 2: Calculating Present Value with Compound Interest

### Problem
You want to determine the present value of $10,000 that you will receive in 5 years if the interest rate is 8% per annum, compounded quarterly.

### Solution
Given:
- \( A = 10000 \) (Future amount)
- \( R = 8\% = 0.08 \) (Annual interest rate)
- \( n = 4 \) (Compounded quarterly)
- \( T = 5 \) years (Time period)

Using the present value formula for compound interest:

\[
PV = \frac{10000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.08}{4}\right)^{4 \times 5}}
\]

\[
PV = \frac{10000}{\left(1 + 0.02\right)^{20}}
\]

\[
PV = \frac{10000}{1.485947} \approx 6730.68
\]

### Explanation
The present value of $10,000 to be received in 5 years, at an 8% annual interest rate compounded quarterly, is approximately $6,730.68. This implies that $6,730.68 today is equivalent to $10,000 in 5 years under the given interest rate and compounding frequency.
