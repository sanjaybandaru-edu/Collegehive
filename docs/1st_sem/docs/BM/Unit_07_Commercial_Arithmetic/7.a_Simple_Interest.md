# 7.a Simple Interest

## Introduction

Simple interest is a basic concept in commercial arithmetic used to calculate the interest earned or paid on a principal amount for a certain period of time at a specified rate of interest. It is called "simple" because the interest is calculated only on the original principal, not on the accumulated interest.


The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} (SI) = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) = Principal amount (the initial sum of money)
- \( R \) = Rate of interest per annum (as a percentage)
- \( T \) = Time period for which the interest is calculated (in years)

The total amount to be paid or received at the end of the period can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Total Amount} (A) = P + SI
\]

## Example 1: Calculating Simple Interest on a Loan

### Problem
John borrows $1,000 from a bank at a rate of 5% per annum for 3 years. Calculate the simple interest and the total amount he has to pay at the end of 3 years.

### Solution
Given:
- \( P = 1000 \) (Principal amount)
- \( R = 5 \% \) (Rate of interest)
- \( T = 3 \) years (Time period)

Using the simple interest formula:

\[
SI = \frac{1000 \times 5 \times 3}{100}
\]

\[
SI = \frac{15000}{100} = 150
\]

So, the simple interest for 3 years is $150.

The total amount to be paid at the end of 3 years:

\[
A = P + SI = 1000 + 150 = 1150
\]

### Explanation
In this example, John borrowed $1,000 at an interest rate of 5% per year for 3 years. The interest was calculated only on the original principal of $1,000, resulting in a total interest of $150. Therefore, the total amount to be repaid after 3 years is $1,150.

## Example 2: Finding the Principal

### Problem
Sarah wants to save money in a bank account that offers 4% simple interest per annum. If she wants to earn $200 in interest after 2 years, how much should she deposit?

### Solution
Given:
- \( SI = 200 \) (Simple interest)
- \( R = 4 \% \) (Rate of interest)
- \( T = 2 \) years (Time period)

We need to find the principal, \( P \), using the simple interest formula:

\[
200 = \frac{P \times 4 \times 2}{100}
\]

\[
200 = \frac{8P}{100}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 100 to clear the fraction:

\[
20000 = 8P
\]

Dividing by 8:

\[
P = \frac{20000}{8} = 2500
\]

So, Sarah should deposit $2,500 to earn $200 in interest after 2 years.

### Explanation
In this case, we rearranged the simple interest formula to solve for the principal. Sarah needed a principal of $2,500 to earn $200 in interest.
