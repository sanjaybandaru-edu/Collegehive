# Unbalanced Transportation Problem

An **unbalanced transportation problem** occurs when the total supply is not equal to the total demand in a transportation problem. In other words, the sum of the supplies at all sources does not match the sum of the demands at all destinations.

- **If total supply exceeds total demand**, a "dummy" destination is added to absorb the excess supply. The transportation cost to this dummy destination is set to zero.
- **If total demand exceeds total supply**, a "dummy" source is added to cover the shortfall in supply. The transportation cost from this dummy source is set to zero.

These adjustments help convert the problem into a balanced form so that standard transportation algorithms can be applied.

## Example of an Unbalanced Transportation Problem

Suppose we have three factories (A, B, C) supplying goods to three warehouses (X, Y, Z), with the following supply and demand:

|   | X  | Y  | Z  | Supply |
|---|----|----|----|--------|
| A | 4  | 6  | 8  | 50     |
| B | 2  | 5  | 7  | 60     |
| C | 3  | 4  | 6  | 40     |
| **Demand** | **30** | **70** | **20** |        |

Here, the **total supply is 50 + 60 + 40 = 150**, and the **total demand is 30 + 70 + 20 = 120**. Since **supply exceeds demand**, this is an unbalanced problem.

## Step 1: Balancing the Problem

To balance the problem, we need to add a **dummy destination** to absorb the excess supply. The excess supply is calculated as:

\[
150 \text{ (total supply)} - 120 \text{ (total demand)} = 30
\]

We add a dummy column (let's call it **D**) with a demand of 30. The transportation cost to this dummy destination is set to zero.

The modified transportation table becomes:

|   | X  | Y  | Z  | D (Dummy) | Supply |
|---|----|----|----|-----------|--------|
| A | 4  | 6  | 8  | 0         | 50     |
| B | 2  | 5  | 7  | 0         | 60     |
| C | 3  | 4  | 6  | 0         | 40     |
| **Demand** | **30** | **70** | **20** | **30**      | 

Now, the total supply (150) equals the total demand (150), making the problem balanced.

## Step 2: Solving the Balanced Problem

Now that the problem is balanced, we can solve it using any of the standard methods, such as the **North-West Corner Rule**, **Least Cost Method**, or **Vogel's Approximation Method**.

### Example Solution using the Least Cost Method

1. **Select the cell with the lowest cost:** B-X (cost = 2).
   - Allocate 30 units to B-X (min of 60 supply at B and 30 demand at X).
   - Update the remaining supply at B to 30 and cross out column X (demand met).

2. **Select the next lowest cost:** B-Y (cost = 5).
   - Allocate 30 units to B-Y (min of 30 supply at B and 70 demand at Y).
   - Update the remaining supply at B to 0 and cross out row B (supply exhausted).

3. **Select the next lowest cost:** C-Y (cost = 4).
   - Allocate 40 units to C-Y (min of 40 supply at C and 40 remaining demand at Y).
   - Update the remaining supply at C to 0 and cross out row C (supply exhausted).

4. **Allocate the remaining units to the dummy destination:** A-D (cost = 0).
   - Allocate 30 units to A-D (remaining supply at A).
   - Update the supply at A to 0 and cross out row A (supply exhausted).

## Final Allocation

The final allocation table is:

|   | X  | Y  | Z  | D (Dummy) |
|---|----|----|----|-----------|
| A | 0  | 0  | 20 | 30        |
| B | 30 | 30 | 0  | 0         |
| C | 0  | 40 | 0  | 0         |

## Summary

- **Unbalanced transportation problems** occur when total supply does not equal total demand.
- To balance the problem, **add a dummy source or destination** with the required supply or demand.
- The **dummy row or column** is used to absorb the excess supply or demand, with transportation costs set to zero.
- Once balanced, the problem can be solved using standard transportation methods.
