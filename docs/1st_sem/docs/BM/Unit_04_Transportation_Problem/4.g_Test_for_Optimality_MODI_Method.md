# Test for Optimality: MODI (Modified Distribution) Method

The **MODI (Modified Distribution) Method**, also known as the **UV method**, is used to check the optimality of an initial feasible solution for a transportation problem and improve it if necessary. It calculates opportunity costs for non-basic cells (cells not currently in the solution) and adjusts allocations based on these costs to find the optimal solution.

## Steps for the MODI Method

1. **Obtain an initial feasible solution** using any method (e.g., North-West Corner Rule, Least Cost Method, Vogel’s Approximation Method). The solution should satisfy the supply and demand requirements with the minimum number of allocations, which is `(m + n - 1)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

2. **Calculate the values of dual variables (U and V).**
   - For each occupied cell `(i, j)` in the solution, use the formula `U_i + V_j = C_ij`, where `C_ij` is the cost for that cell.
   - Set `U_1 = 0` (arbitrarily) and calculate the other values of `U` and `V` based on the equation for the occupied cells.

3. **Compute the opportunity cost (Δ_ij) for each unoccupied cell.**
   - Use the formula: `Δ_ij = C_ij - (U_i + V_j)`.
   - If all `Δ_ij` values are **greater than or equal to zero**, the current solution is optimal.

4. **If any Δ_ij is negative**, the current solution is not optimal. Identify the cell with the most negative `Δ_ij` to bring into the solution and adjust the allocations to form a closed loop.

5. **Make the new allocations** using the stepping-stone path and repeat the process until all opportunity costs are non-negative.

## Example of the MODI Method

Consider a transportation problem with three factories (A, B, C) supplying goods to three warehouses (X, Y, Z). The supply, demand, and transportation costs are given as follows:

|   | X  | Y  | Z  | Supply |
|---|----|----|----|--------|
| A | 4  | 8  | 8  | 60     |
| B | 2  | 5  | 6  | 70     |
| C | 3  | 8  | 6  | 50     |
| **Demand** | **50** | **80** | **50** |        |

### Step 1: Obtain an Initial Feasible Solution

Using the Least Cost Method, we get the following initial feasible solution:

|   | X  | Y  | Z  | Supply |
|---|----|----|----|--------|
| A | 50 | 10 | 0  | 60     |
| B | 0  | 70 | 0  | 70     |
| C | 0  | 0  | 50 | 50     |
| **Demand** | **50** | **80** | **50** |        |

### Step 2: Calculate the U and V Values

We have occupied cells: (A-X), (A-Y), (B-Y), and (C-Z).

1. Set `U_A = 0` (arbitrarily).
2. Calculate the other U and V values:
   - For (A-X): `U_A + V_X = 4` → `0 + V_X = 4` → `V_X = 4`.
   - For (A-Y): `U_A + V_Y = 8` → `0 + V_Y = 8` → `V_Y = 8`.
   - For (B-Y): `U_B + V_Y = 5` → `U_B + 8 = 5` → `U_B = -3`.
   - For (C-Z): `U_C + V_Z = 6` → `U_C + V_Z = 6`. Assume `U_C = 0`, then `V_Z = 6`.

### Step 3: Compute Opportunity Costs (Δ_ij)

Calculate Δ_ij for each unoccupied cell:

- For (B-X): `Δ_BX = C_BX - (U_B + V_X) = 2 - (-3 + 4) = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- For (B-Z): `Δ_BZ = C_BZ - (U_B + V_Z) = 6 - (-3 + 6) = 6 - 3 = 3`.
- For (C-Y): `Δ_CY = C_CY - (U_C + V_Y) = 8 - (0 + 8) = 8 - 8 = 0`.

### Step 4: Check Optimality

Since all opportunity costs are **greater than or equal to zero**, the current solution is **optimal**.

## Summary

- The **MODI Method** is used to check the optimality of an initial feasible solution and adjust it if needed by recalculating allocations based on opportunity costs.
- **If all opportunity costs are non-negative**, the current solution is optimal.
- **If any opportunity costs are negative**, adjustments need to be made using a stepping-stone path to improve the solution.
