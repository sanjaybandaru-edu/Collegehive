# Vogel's Approximation Method for Transportation Problems

Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) is a heuristic used to find an initial feasible solution for transportation problems in linear programming. It aims to achieve a better initial solution by considering the penalty cost associated with not choosing the least cost route. The penalty is calculated as the difference between the lowest and second-lowest costs in each row and column, guiding the allocation process by highlighting where the greatest potential cost savings can be achieved.

## Steps to Apply Vogel's Approximation Method

1. **Calculate the penalty for each row and column.**
   - The penalty is the difference between the two smallest costs in each row and column.
2. **Identify the row or column with the highest penalty.**
   - If there's a tie, break it arbitrarily.
3. **Allocate as much as possible** to the cell with the lowest cost in the selected row or column.
4. **Adjust the supply and demand** based on the allocation:
   - Subtract the allocated amount from both the corresponding row's supply and the column's demand.
5. **Cross out the row or column** if the supply or demand is exhausted.
   - If both are exhausted simultaneously, cross out one and set the remaining supply/demand of the other to zero.
6. **Repeat steps 1-5** until all supplies and demands are met.

## Example Problem

Consider three factories (A, B, C) supplying goods to three warehouses (X, Y, Z). The transportation costs per unit, supplies, and demands are given below:

|   | X  | Y  | Z  | Supply |
|---|----|----|----|--------|
| A | 2  | 3  | 1  | 30     |
| B | 5  | 4  | 8  | 40     |
| C | 5  | 6  | 8  | 20     |
| **Demand** | **20** | **50** | **20** |        |

### Step 1: Calculate the penalties for each row and column.

- **Row A**: The smallest costs are 1 and 2, so the penalty is `2 - 1 = 1`.
- **Row B**: The smallest costs are 4 and 5, so the penalty is `5 - 4 = 1`.
- **Row C**: The smallest costs are 5 and 6, so the penalty is `6 - 5 = 1`.
- **Column X**: The smallest costs are 2 and 5, so the penalty is `5 - 2 = 3`.
- **Column Y**: The smallest costs are 3 and 4, so the penalty is `4 - 3 = 1`.
- **Column Z**: The smallest costs are 1 and 8, so the penalty is `8 - 1 = 7`.

### Step 2: Identify the highest penalty.

- The highest penalty is 7 for **column Z**.

### Step 3: Allocate to the cell with the lowest cost in column Z.

- The lowest cost in column Z is 1 (A-Z).
- The supply at A is 30, and the demand at Z is 20.
- Allocate 20 units to A-Z.
- Update the remaining supply at A to `30 - 20 = 10` and the remaining demand at Z to `20 - 20 = 0`.
- Cross out column Z.

### Step 4: Recalculate the penalties.

After crossing out column Z, recalculate penalties for the remaining rows and columns:

- **Row A**: The smallest costs are 2 and 3, so the penalty is `3 - 2 = 1`.
- **Row B**: The smallest costs are 4 and 5, so the penalty is `5 - 4 = 1`.
- **Row C**: The smallest costs are 5 and 6, so the penalty is `6 - 5 = 1`.
- **Column X**: The smallest costs are 2 and 5, so the penalty is `5 - 2 = 3`.
- **Column Y**: The smallest costs are 3 and 4, so the penalty is `4 - 3 = 1`.

### Step 5: Allocate to the row or column with the highest penalty.

- The highest penalty is 3 for **column X**.

### Step 6: Allocate to the cell with the lowest cost in column X.

- The lowest cost in column X is 2 (A-X).
- The supply at A is 10, and the demand at X is 20.
- Allocate 10 units to A-X.
- Update the remaining supply at A to `10 - 10 = 0` and the remaining demand at X to `20 - 10 = 10`.
- Cross out row A.

### Step 7: Recalculate the penalties.

After crossing out row A, recalculate penalties for the remaining rows and columns:

- **Row B**: The smallest costs are 4 and 5, so the penalty is `5 - 4 = 1`.
- **Row C**: The smallest costs are 5 and 6, so the penalty is `6 - 5 = 1`.
- **Column X**: The only cost left is 5, so the penalty is 0.
- **Column Y**: The smallest costs are 4 and 6, so the penalty is `6 - 4 = 2`.

### Step 8: Allocate to the row or column with the highest penalty.

- The highest penalty is 2 for **column Y**.

### Step 9: Allocate to the cell with the lowest cost in column Y.

- The lowest cost in column Y is 4 (B-Y).
- The supply at B is 40, and the demand at Y is 50.
- Allocate 40 units to B-Y.
- Update the remaining supply at B to `40 - 40 = 0` and the remaining demand at Y to `50 - 40 = 10`.
- Cross out row B.

### Step 10: Allocate the remaining units.

- The only remaining cell is C-Y with a demand of 10 and a supply of 20.
- Allocate 10 units to C-Y.
- Update the remaining supply at C to `20 - 10 = 10` and the remaining demand at Y to `10 - 10 = 0`.

## Final Allocation

The final allocations are as follows:

|   | X  | Y  | Z  |
|---|----|----|----|
| A | 10 | 0  | 20 |
| B | 0  | 40 | 0  |
| C | 0  | 10 | 0  |

## Summary

- Vogel's Approximation Method attempts to find a better initial feasible solution by considering the penalties associated with not choosing the least cost route.
- This method often provides a good starting solution, but further optimization using techniques like the stepping-stone method or the MODI (Modified Distribution) method may be needed to reach the optimal solution.
