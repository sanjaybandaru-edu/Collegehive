# Accounting Equation

The **accounting equation** represents the relationship between the **assets**, **liabilities**, and **capital** (owner’s equity) of a business. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in accounting and serves as the foundation for preparing a **balance sheet**. The accounting equation is expressed as:

\[
A = C + L
\]

 ### Asset = Liability + Capital
### Liabilities = Assets - Capital
### Owners’ Equity (Capital) = Assets – Liabilities

Where:
- **A = Assets**: Resources owned by the business.
- **C = Capital** (Owner’s equity): The owner's claim on the assets of the business.
- **L = Liabilities**: The obligations the business owes to outsiders.

### The Balance Sheet Equation:

The accounting equation is also referred to as the **balance sheet equation** because it reflects the fundamental relationship between assets, liabilities, and capital, which are key components of the balance sheet.

### Key Concept:

The accounting equation states that, at any given point in time, the **resources** of a business entity (assets) must equal the total **claims** against those resources. These claims come from two sources:
1. **Capital (Owner's equity)**: Claims by the business owner(s).
2. **Liabilities**: Claims by external parties (creditors or lenders).

### Significance:

The **accounting equation** ensures that a business’s financial records are in balance, meaning the value of the business's assets is always equal to the sum of its liabilities and owner’s equity. This reflects the financial position of the business and ensures that the assets side of the balance sheet is equal to the sum of the liabilities and capital side.

## Conclusion:

The **accounting equation** is fundamental in accounting, ensuring that every financial transaction maintains the balance between a business's assets, liabilities, and capital. It is essential for preparing accurate financial statements, particularly the **balance sheet**, as it highlights the equality between what a business owns and how those assets are financed.
