# Accounting Standards

**Accounting Standards** are authoritative standards for financial reporting and form the primary source of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These standards serve as guidelines for preparing financial statements and ensure consistency and transparency in how financial transactions are recorded and reported.

## Key Points:

- **Authoritative Standards**: Accounting standards are considered authoritative and provide the foundational rules for financial reporting, which make up the core of GAAP.
- **Guidelines for Financial Statements**: These standards guide how transactions and other financial events are **recognized**, **measured**, **presented**, and **disclosed** in the financial statements of a company.
- **Uniformity and Transparency**: By following accounting standards, businesses achieve **uniformity** in accounting practices, ensuring **transparency**, **consistency**, and **comparability** across financial reports.

### Purpose of Accounting Standards:

The primary objective of accounting standards is to standardize the accounting practices used by businesses, ensuring that financial statements are accurate and comparable across different entities. This helps stakeholders such as investors, auditors, and regulatory authorities make informed decisions based on reliable financial information.
