#  Preparation of Balance Sheet of Sole Trading Concerns

A **Balance Sheet** is a financial statement that shows the financial position of a business at a specific point in time. For a **Sole Trading Concern**, the balance sheet lists the **assets**, **liabilities**, and **capital** of the business, providing a snapshot of the business's overall financial health. It is typically prepared at the end of an accounting period (monthly, quarterly, or annually).

## 2. Format of a Balance Sheet

The Balance Sheet follows the **accounting equation**:
\[
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Owner’s Equity (Capital)}
\]
This equation ensures that the balance sheet "balances" — total assets must always equal the total liabilities and owner’s equity.

The Balance Sheet is generally prepared in a **T-format** or a **vertical format**, with the left side listing **Liabilities and Capital** and the right side listing **Assets**.

### **Liabilities and Capital (Left Side)**

This section shows the obligations and the owner's investment in the business.

### 1. **Capital**:
   - Represents the amount invested by the owner in the business, adjusted for **Net Profit** or **Net Loss** (from the Profit & Loss Account) and any **Drawings** (money taken by the owner for personal use).
   - **Capital Formula**:
     \[
     \text{Capital} = \text{Opening Capital} + \text{Net Profit} - \text{Drawings}
     \]
   - If there is a loss, it will reduce the capital.

### 2. **Liabilities**:
   - **Current Liabilities**: Obligations that must be paid within a short period, usually within one year. Examples include:
     - **Creditors**: Amounts owed to suppliers for goods purchased on credit.
     - **Bank Overdraft**: A negative balance in a bank account.
     - **Outstanding Expenses**: Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid (e.g., unpaid wages, rent).
   - **Long-Term Liabilities**: Debts that are payable over a longer period, such as:
     - **Loans**: Long-term loans taken from banks or financial institutions.

### **Assets (Right Side)**

This section shows what the business owns and how its resources are deployed.

   - Assets that are purchased for long-term use in the business and are not intended for resale. Examples include:
     - **Land and Buildings**: Property owned by the business.
     - **Plant and Machinery**: Equipment used in the production process.
     - **Furniture and Fixtures**: Items like office desks, chairs, etc.
     - **Vehicles**: Delivery trucks, company cars, etc.

### 2. **Current Assets**:
   - Assets that are expected to be converted into cash within a short period, typically within one year. Examples include:
     - **Cash in Hand**: Physical cash available with the business.
     - **Cash at Bank**: The balance in the business’s bank account.
     - **Debtors**: Customers who owe money to the business for goods or services sold on credit.
     - **Stock (Inventory)**: Goods available for sale at the end of the period.
