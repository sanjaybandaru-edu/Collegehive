# Three Column Cash Book

A **Three Column Cash Book** is an extension of the double column cash book, with an additional **bank column** on both the debit and credit sides. This allows the business to record **cash transactions**, **discounts**, and **bank transactions** in a single cash book, eliminating the need to maintain a separate bank account in the ledger.

### Key Features:

- **Three Columns** on Each Side:
  - **Cash Column**: Records all cash transactions, such as cash receipts and cash payments.
  - **Discount Column**: Records discounts allowed (on the debit side) and discounts received (on the credit side).
  - **Bank Column**: Records all transactions related to deposits in and withdrawals from the bank.

### Purpose of the Bank Column:
- The bank column records **banking transactions**, such as deposits made to the bank or payments made through the bank. This ensures that all bank-related activities are tracked in the same book as cash and discount entries.
- With the addition of the bank column, there is **no need to open a separate bank account in the ledger**, as all bank transactions are already recorded in the cash book.

### Ledger Posting:
- **Cash transactions** are posted in the cash column.
- **Discounts** are posted in the discount column and transferred to the ledger accounts for **Discount Allowed** or **Discount Received**.
- **Bank transactions** are posted in the bank column and treated similarly to cash transactions, without requiring a separate bank ledger account.

### Example:

If a business:
- Receives Rs. 15,000 in cash from a debtor with a discount of Rs. 1,000.
- Deposits Rs. 10,000 into the bank.
- Pays Rs. 7,000 to a creditor via a bank transfer with a discount of Rs. 500.

In the **three column cash book**:
- On the **debit side**: 
  - Cash = Rs. 15,000, Discount = Rs. 1,000, Bank = Rs. 10,000 (deposited).
- On the **credit side**: 
  - Bank = Rs. 7,000 (paid), Discount = Rs. 500.

The corresponding discount totals are posted to the appropriate **Discount Allowed** and **Discount Received** ledger accounts, while bank transactions are recorded directly in the cash book, replacing the need for a separate bank ledger.

## Conclusion:

The **Three Column Cash Book** is a comprehensive tool for recording **cash**, **discount**, and **bank transactions** in one place. By consolidating all financial transactions, including those involving the bank, businesses no longer need a separate bank account in the ledger. This helps streamline accounting processes and ensures a clear record of financial activities.
