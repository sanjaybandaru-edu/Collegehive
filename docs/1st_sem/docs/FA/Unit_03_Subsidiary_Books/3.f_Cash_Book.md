# Cash Book

A **Cash Book** is a financial record used to track all cash-related transactions of a business. It records payments made in cash, receipts from customers, payments to creditors, cash deposited into the bank, and withdrawals of cash for office use. Examples of cash transactions include cash expenses, revenue collected in cash, payments received from debtors, and payments made to creditors.

While double column and triple column cash books are primarily used for academic purposes, organizations often maintain separate **bank books** to record all banking transactions, as they typically outnumber cash transactions. Cash is usually reserved for petty and routine expenditures, while employee salaries and other large expenses are handled through **bank transfers**.

2. The **cash book always shows a debit balance**, representing cash in hand, which is categorized as a part of current assets.
