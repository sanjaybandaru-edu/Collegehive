# Sales Book

The **Sales Book** is a specialized accounting book used to record all **credit sales** of goods. It only includes sales made on credit, and **cash sales** are not recorded here as they are directly recorded in the **cash book**.

### Key Features:
- **Records Credit Sales**: Only sales made on credit are recorded in the sales book.
- **Excludes Cash Sales**: Cash sales are not included; they are recorded in the cash book.
- **No Posting to Ledger Immediately**: Each credit sale recorded in the sales book is later posted to individual customer accounts in the **Sales Ledger**.
  
### Purpose:
The sales book helps businesses keep a record of all credit transactions related to the sale of goods. This ensures that the total sales for a period can be easily calculated without tracking cash sales.

### Example:
If a business sells goods worth Rs. 20,000 to a customer on credit, it will be recorded in the sales book as:

| Date       | Customer Name | Invoice No. | Details of Goods Sold | Amount (Rs.) |
|------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| 01/10/2024 | XYZ Company    | 123         | 10 units of product A  | 20,000       |

---

## Conclusion:
The **Sales Book** simplifies the process of tracking credit sales, allowing businesses to maintain detailed records of customers who purchased on credit, while separating these transactions from cash sales.
