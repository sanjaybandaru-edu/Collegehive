# Single Column Cash Book

The **Single Column Cash Book** is a basic type of cash book used to record all cash transactions of a business. It functions similarly to a **ledger account**, meaning there is no need to open a separate cash account in the ledger. The balance from the cash book is directly posted to the **trial balance** at the end of the accounting period.

Since the cash book represents a **real account**, the following accounting rule is applied:
- **Debit**: What comes in (cash received).
- **Credit**: What goes out (cash paid).

### Key Features:

- **Cash Transactions Only**: The single column cash book is used to record **only cash transactions**, such as cash receipts, payments, and expenses.
  
- **Debit Side**: All cash received by the business is posted on the **debit side** of the cash book.
  
- **Credit Side**: All cash payments and expenses incurred by the business are posted on the **credit side** of the cash book.
  
- **No Separate Cash Account**: As the cash book itself functions as the **cash account**, there is no need to maintain a separate cash account in the ledger.
  
- **Posting to Trial Balance**: The closing balance of the cash book is posted directly to the trial balance, reflecting the cash in hand at the end of the period.

### Accounting Rule for the Single Column Cash Book:

Since the cash account is categorized as a **real account**, the following rule is followed when recording transactions:
- **Debit** what comes in (e.g., cash received from sales).
- **Credit** what goes out (e.g., payments made for expenses).
