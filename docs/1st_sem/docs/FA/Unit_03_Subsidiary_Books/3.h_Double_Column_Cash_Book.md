# Double Column Cash Book

The **Double Column Cash Book** is an extension of the single column cash book, with an additional column for **discounts** on both the debit and credit sides. This allows businesses to track both cash transactions and discount amounts offered or received during the period.

### Key Features:

- **Two Columns** on Each Side:
  - **Cash Column**: Records all cash transactions such as cash receipts and cash payments.
  - **Discount Column**: Records discounts related to transactions with debtors (customers) and creditors (suppliers).

- **Debit Side (Discount Allowed)**:
  - The **debit side discount column** records the **discount allowed** to debtors (customers). This occurs when the business offers a reduction in price to customers who make early payments or for other promotional reasons.
  
- **Credit Side (Discount Received)**:
  - The **credit side discount column** records the **discount received** from creditors (suppliers). This happens when the business receives a reduction in the amount payable to suppliers for early payment or other negotiated discounts.

### Ledger Posting:

At the end of the accounting period, the totals from the discount columns are posted to their respective ledger accounts:

- **Discount Allowed to Customers**:
  - The total from the **debit side discount column** is posted to the **Discount Allowed** ledger account, with the entry: **"To Total As Per Cash Book"**.
  
- **Discount Received from Creditors**:
  - The total from the **credit side discount column** is posted to the **Discount Received** ledger account, with the entry: **"By Total As Per Cash Book"**.

### Example:

Suppose a business records the following transactions:
- Receives Rs. 10,000 in cash from a debtor, with a discount of Rs. 500.
- Pays Rs. 5,000 to a creditor, receiving a discount of Rs. 200.

In the **double column cash book**:
- On the **debit side** (cash received from debtor): 
  - Cash = Rs. 10,000, Discount = Rs. 500.
- On the **credit side** (cash paid to creditor): 
  - Cash = Rs. 5,000, Discount = Rs. 200.

At the end of the period:
- The **Rs. 500 discount** allowed to the debtor is posted to the **Discount Allowed to Customers** ledger.
- The **Rs. 200 discount** received from the creditor is posted to the **Discount Received from Creditors** ledger.
