# Sales Return Book

The **Sales Return Book**, also known as the **Return Inward Book**, records the return of goods previously sold on credit. It helps track goods that customers return due to issues like defects or incorrect deliveries.

### Key Features:
- **Records Goods Returned by Customers**: It tracks all goods returned by customers who initially purchased them on credit.
- **Excludes Cash Sale Returns**: Goods returned from cash sales are recorded in the cash book, not in the sales return book.
- **Reduces Sales**: These returns reduce the total sales value for the period and are posted in the **Sales Return Ledger**.

### Purpose:
The sales return book is used to record and track goods returned by customers, ensuring accurate accounting for returned products and sales adjustments.
