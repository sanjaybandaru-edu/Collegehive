Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Alt + G` to open the **Go To** menu and type "Profit & Loss" to access it directly.

### Step 3: Set the Reporting Period

- The Profit & Loss report will default to the financial year. However, you can change the period by pressing `Alt + F2` and entering the **From** and **To** dates to view the income statement for a specific period.
  - **Example**: If you want to view the Income Statement for the month of April, set the period from `1-April-YYYY` to `30-April-YYYY`.

### Step 4: View the Income Statement

- After selecting the reporting period, the **Profit & Loss Account** will display the businessâ€™s revenue, direct expenses, gross profit, indirect expenses, and the final **Net Profit/Loss** for the chosen period.
