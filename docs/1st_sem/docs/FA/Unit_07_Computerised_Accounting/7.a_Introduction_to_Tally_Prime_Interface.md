### 2. Cost Reduction
Tally helps businesses save money by reducing the costs associated with paper-based record-keeping and file transfer. It also eliminates the need for manual data maintenance.

### 3. Fast Data Processing
Tally automates accounting processes, reducing the time spent on manual calculations and ensuring faster transactions.
