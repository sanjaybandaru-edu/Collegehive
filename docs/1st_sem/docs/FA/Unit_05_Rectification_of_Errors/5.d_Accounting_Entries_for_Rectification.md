# Accounting Entries for Rectification

In accounting, errors can occur at various stages, such as during journal entry, ledger posting, or the preparation of financial statements. Once these errors are detected, they need to be corrected through **rectification entries**. The rectification process involves passing journal entries to reverse the incorrect entry and record the correct one. The nature of the error determines the type of rectification entry required.


## 2. Types of Errors and Their Rectification Entries

### 2.1 Errors Affecting One Account

These errors occur when only one aspect of a transaction (debit or credit) is recorded incorrectly. Common examples include posting an amount to the wrong account or posting to the wrong side of an account.

#### Example 1: Wrong Account Posting
A payment of ₹5,000 towards rent was wrongly debited to the **Wages Account** instead of the **Rent Account**.

**Incorrect Entry**:
```plaintext
Wages A/c          Dr.  ₹5,000
   To Cash A/c                ₹5,000

Rectification Entry:

Rent A/c           Dr.  ₹5,000
   To Wages A/c               ₹5,000

Wrong Side Posting
A credit purchase of ₹8,000 was mistakenly posted to the Creditors Account on the wrong side (debited instead of credited).

Incorrect Entry:

Creditors A/c      Dr.  ₹8,000
   To Purchases A/c          ₹8,000

Rectification Entry:

Purchases A/c      Dr.  ₹8,000
   To Creditors A/c          ₹8,000
This entry reverses the wrong debit and correctly posts the purchase to the Creditors Account on the credit side.

2.2 Errors Affecting Two or More Accounts
These errors occur when both the debit and credit aspects of a transaction are recorded incorrectly, either with wrong amounts or wrong accounts.

Example 1: Wrong Amount in Both Accounts
A sales transaction of ₹20,000 was mistakenly recorded as ₹2,000 in both the Sales Account and the Debtor’s Account.

Incorrect Entry:

Debtors A/c        Dr.  ₹2,000
   To Sales A/c              ₹2,000

Rectification Entry:

Debtors A/c        Dr.  ₹18,000
   To Sales A/c              ₹18,000
This entry corrects the understatement by recording the additional ₹18,000 in both the Debtors Account and the Sales Account.

Example 2: Incorrect Accounts Used
A purchase of office supplies worth ₹3,000 was wrongly debited to the Furniture Account instead of the Office Supplies Account.

Incorrect Entry:

Furniture A/c      Dr.  ₹3,000
   To Cash A/c                ₹3,000

Rectification Entry:

Office Supplies A/c Dr.  ₹3,000
   To Furniture A/c            ₹3,000
This entry transfers the amount from the Furniture Account to the correct Office Supplies Account.

2.3 Errors of Omission
These errors occur when a transaction is either wholly or partially omitted from the books. For partial omissions, only one side of the transaction is recorded, while the other is missing.

Example 1: Complete Omission
A credit purchase of ₹15,000 was entirely omitted from the books.

Rectification Entry:

Purchases A/c      Dr.  ₹15,000
   To Creditors A/c          ₹15,000
