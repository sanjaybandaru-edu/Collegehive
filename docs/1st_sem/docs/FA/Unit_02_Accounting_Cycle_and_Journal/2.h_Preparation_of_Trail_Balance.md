# Preparation of Trial Balance

A **Trial Balance** is a statement that lists all the general ledger accounts of a business at a specific date. The trial balance is prepared to verify that the total debits equal the total credits after posting all journal entries and ledger transactions. It helps in identifying any errors in the accounting process and ensures that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced.

### Purpose of a Trial Balance:
- To check the **arithmetic accuracy** of the ledger accounts.
- To ensure that **total debits equal total credits**.
- To help in the preparation of **financial statements** such as the profit and loss account and balance sheet.

### Steps to Prepare a Trial Balance:
1. **List all ledger accounts**: Gather all the accounts from the general ledger.
2. **Post the debit or credit balance**: Each account’s balance (debit or credit) is posted in the respective debit or credit column in the trial balance.
3. **Total the debit and credit columns**: Add up all the debit balances and all the credit balances.
4. **Check for equality**: Ensure that the total of the debit column equals the total of the credit column. If they are not equal, there might be an error in the ledger entries or postings.

7. Rent expense: Rs. 20,000
8. Salaries expense: Rs. 40,000
9. Capital: Rs. 135,000
