## Capital Expenditures (CapEx)

**Capital Expenditures (CapEx)** refer to the spending made by a business on acquiring or improving long-term assets that are expected to generate revenue over an extended period. These assets provide benefits to the business for multiple years and are a part of the company's long-term growth strategy.

### Examples of CapEx:
- **Buildings**: Purchasing or constructing new office buildings, factories, or warehouses.
- **Machinery and Equipment**: Acquiring new machinery or equipment used for production or operations.
- **Vehicles**: Purchasing company vehicles for transportation or delivery purposes.
- **Technology Infrastructure**: Investments in computer systems, servers, or specialized software that support business operations.

### Accounting Treatment of CapEx:
- **Recorded as Assets**: CapEx is recorded on the **balance sheet** as an asset because the expenditure provides future economic benefits to the company.
- **Depreciation**: Since capital expenditures benefit the business over a long period, the cost of these assets is **gradually depreciated** over their useful life. Depreciation reduces the value of the asset over time and is recorded as an expense in the income statement.
  
### Purpose of CapEx:
- CapEx is aimed at **long-term growth and expansion**. It involves investing in assets that will support the business’s operations for years to come, contributing to increased production capacity, operational efficiency, or improved product quality.

## Revenue Expenditures (RevEx)

**Revenue Expenditures (RevEx)** refer to short-term expenses incurred during the regular, day-to-day operations of a business. These expenses are necessary to maintain the company’s current operations but do not provide long-term benefits like CapEx.

### Examples of RevEx:
- **Salaries**: Payment of wages to employees for their work during the accounting period.
- **Rent**: Payment for leasing office space, retail locations, or warehouses.
- **Utilities**: Expenses related to electricity, water, and other utilities consumed during business operations.
- **Supplies**: Purchase of office supplies, raw materials, or consumables required for the daily functioning of the business.

### Accounting Treatment of RevEx:
- **Recorded as Expenses**: RevEx is recorded on the **income statement** as an **expense**. These expenses are deducted from the company’s revenue during the same period in which they occur.
- **Immediate Impact on Profit**: Since revenue expenditures are incurred in the normal course of business, they are immediately deducted from revenues and affect the **profit or loss** of the business in the current accounting period.

### Purpose of RevEx:
- RevEx is aimed at **maintaining day-to-day operations** and ensuring that the business continues to function smoothly. These expenses are incurred regularly and do not contribute to the long-term growth of the business, unlike CapEx.
