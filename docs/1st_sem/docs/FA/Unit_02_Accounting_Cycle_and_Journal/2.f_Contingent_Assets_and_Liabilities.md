**Contingent assets and liabilities** are potential assets and liabilities that are not recognized in the financial statements because their existence depends on uncertain future events. They are only disclosed when certain conditions are met, and their outcome can influence the financial position of a company.

A **contingent asset** is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events, which are beyond the companyâ€™s control.

### Key Points about Contingent Assets:
- **Disclosure in Financial Statements**: Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when it is **more likely than not** that an inflow of economic benefits will occur. 
- **Example**: If a company has a strong chance of winning a lawsuit against another party, this could be considered a contingent asset. The potential future benefit (e.g., damages awarded) will be disclosed, but not recognized as an asset until the uncertainty is resolved.

## Contingent Liabilities:

A **contingent liability** is a potential obligation that may arise based on the outcome of an uncertain future event. It becomes a liability only if the uncertain future event occurs.

### Key Points about Contingent Liabilities:
- **Disclosure in Financial Statements**: Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the financial statements when the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is **not remote**.
- **Example**: A pending lawsuit or warranty obligation is a contingent liability because the outcome and financial impact are uncertain. If the company is likely to lose the lawsuit or needs to honor the warranty, it could lead to a future outflow of resources.

## Conclusion:

**Contingent assets and liabilities** provide valuable information about potential future economic benefits or obligations, but their uncertain nature means they are not recognized in the main financial statements. Instead, they are **disclosed** in the notes, offering insight into possible risks or rewards the company may face. Understanding contingent liabilities is particularly important, as they can impact a company's future financial position if they become actual obligations.
