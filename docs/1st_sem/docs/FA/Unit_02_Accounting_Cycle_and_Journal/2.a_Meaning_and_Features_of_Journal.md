A **journal** is a record of financial transactions where transactions of a business are ordered by date. It is known as the **book of original entry**, as each transaction is first recorded here before being posted to the respective accounts. Journals are used in accounting to ensure transactions are properly documented for future reference.

There are different types of journals, such as:
- Sales journal
- Purchases journal
- Cash receipts journal
- Cash disbursements journal
- General journal

## Double-Entry Bookkeeping Journal

This is one of the most common methods of accounting. In **double-entry bookkeeping**, each transaction involves two accounts, one to be debited and the other to be credited. Every transaction affects at least two accounts, ensuring the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced.

## Single-Entry Bookkeeping Journal

In **single-entry bookkeeping**, only one account is used to record each transaction. It’s similar to a checkbook, where only the cash inflows and outflows are tracked, and it doesn’t provide a comprehensive picture of the business’s financial position. This method is simpler but is usually suited for smaller businesses.

## Features of a Journal

Here are five important features of a journal:

1. **Chronological Order**: Transactions are recorded in the journal as they occur, in the exact sequence of their occurrence.
2. **Double-entry system**: For each transaction, both a debit and credit entry are recorded, ensuring every transaction affects two accounts.
3. **Detailed Information**: Each journal entry includes the date, accounts affected, amounts, and a brief narration explaining the transaction.
4. **Basis for Posting**: The journal entries are used to post transactions to the ledger accounts, which further track financial activity.
5. **Adjusting Entries**: These are entries made at the end of an accounting period to adjust income or expense items for accurate financial reporting.
