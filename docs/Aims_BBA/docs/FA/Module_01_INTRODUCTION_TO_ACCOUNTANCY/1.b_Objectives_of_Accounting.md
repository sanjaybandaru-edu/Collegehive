# Objectives of Accounting

Accounting is a systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting financial transactions. The primary objective of accounting is to provide reliable financial information to stakeholders, which includes investors, creditors, and regulatory authorities. The main objectives of accounting are:

1. **Recording and Summarizing Transactions**: Accounting records all financial transactions, including sales, purchases, and expenses, to provide a clear picture of the financial health of the business. This involves categorizing and summarizing transactions into financial statements, such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

2. **Providing Financial Information**: Accounting provides financial information to various stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and regulatory authorities. This information helps them make informed decisions about the business, such as whether to invest, lend, or regulate.

3. **Ensuring Compliance with Regulations**: Accounting ensures that the business complies with financial reporting regulations. This involves following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which provide guidelines for financial reporting.

4. **Making Informed Decisions**: Accounting provides financial information that helps business owners and managers make informed decisions about the business. This includes decisions about resource allocation, pricing strategies, and investment opportunities.

5. **Protecting Stakeholders' Interests**: Accounting helps protect the interests of stakeholders by ensuring that financial information is accurate and reliable. This involves implementing internal controls to prevent fraud and errors, and conducting regular audits to verify the accuracy of financial statements.

In summary, the objectives of accounting are to provide reliable financial information, ensure compliance with regulations, make informed decisions, and protect stakeholders' interests.
