While accounting plays a crucial role in providing financial information and supporting decision-making, it is important to recognize the limitations of accounting. The key limitations of accounting are:

1. **Measurability**:
   - One of the biggest limitations of accounting is that it cannot measure things/events that do not have a monetary value.
   - If a certain factor, no matter how important, cannot be expressed in money, it finds no place in accounting. Some very important qualities like management, loyalty, reputation, etc. find no place on the balance sheet or the income statement.

2. **No Future Assessment**:
   - The financial statements show the financial position of the firm on the date of preparation.
   - The users of the statement are more interested in the future of the company in the short term and long term. However, accounting does not make any such estimates.
   - Due to the dynamic nature of the business environment, a lot can change between such dates.

3. **Historical Costs**:
   - Accounting often uses historical costs to measure the values, failing to take into consideration factors such as inflation, price changes, etc.
   - This skews the relevance of such accounting records and information, which is one of the major limitations of accounting.

4. **Accounting Policies**:
   - There is no global standard in accounting policies. Different countries and organizations follow different standards, such as Accounting Standards, GAAP, and IFRS.
   - This can lead to conflicts and confusion, as not all accounting policies follow the same line of thinking.

5. **Estimates**:
   - Sometimes, in accounting, estimation may be required as it is not possible to establish exact amounts.
   - These estimates will depend on the personal judgment of the accountant and are extremely subjective in nature.

6. **Verifiability**:
   - An audit of the financial statements does not guarantee the correctness of such statements. The auditor can only assure that the statements are free from error to the best of their judgment.

7. **Errors and Frauds**:
   - Accounting is done by humans, so there will always be the scope of human errors.
   - There is also the fear of possible manipulation of accounts to cover up a fraud, which is that much harder to spot.

Recognizing these limitations is important for users of accounting information to interpret the financial data in the appropriate context and supplement it with other relevant information to make informed decisions.
