## 1. **Revenue Per Employee**
   - **Description:** This metric is calculated by dividing the company's total revenue by its number of employees. It indicates the average revenue each employee contributes and is a measure of organizational efficiency in generating revenue through its workforce.
   - **Formula:** `Revenue Per Employee = Total Revenue / Total Number of Employees`

## 2. **Offer Acceptance Rate**
   - **Description:** The offer acceptance rate measures the percentage of job offers that are accepted by candidates. It reflects the attractiveness of the company to potential employees.
   - **Formula:** `Offer Acceptance Rate = (Number of Accepted Offers / Total Number of Offers) * 100`
   - **Benchmark:** A rate above 85% is typically seen as favorable.

## 3. **Training Expenses Per Employee**
   - **Description:** This metric shows the average training cost per employee and helps assess the investment in employee development.
   - **Formula:** `Training Expenses Per Employee = Total Training Expenses / Number of Trained Employees`

## 4. **Training Efficiency**
   - **Description:** Evaluates the effectiveness of training programs through various indicators such as performance improvements and role advancements post-training.
   - **Assessment Criteria:** Performance metrics, test scores, and career progression post-training.

## 5. **Voluntary Turnover Rate**
   - **Description:** The percentage of employees who leave the company voluntarily. High rates may indicate issues in employee satisfaction or engagement.
   - **Formula:** `Voluntary Turnover Rate = (Number of Voluntary Exits / Total Number of Employees) * 100`

## 6. **Involuntary Turnover Rate**
   - **Description:** Reflects the percentage of employees terminated by the organization. It is often used to assess the effectiveness of the recruitment and hiring processes.
   - **Formula:** `Involuntary Turnover Rate = (Number of Involuntary Exits / Total Number of Employees) * 100`

## 7. **Time to Fill**
   - **Description:** Measures the time taken from posting a job opening to filling the position. It helps in evaluating the efficiency of the recruitment process.
   - **Formula:** `Time to Fill = Days from Job Posting to Job Acceptance`

## 8. **Time to Hire**
   - **Description:** The number of days from first contact with a candidate to their acceptance of the job offer. It can indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the recruitment process.
   - **Formula:** `Time to Hire = Days from Initial Contact to Offer Acceptance`

## 9. **Absenteeism**
   - **Description:** This productivity metric measures the rate of unscheduled absences from work. It's an important indicator of overall employee health and job satisfaction.
   - **Formula:** `Absenteeism Rate = (Total Absent Days / Total Scheduled Workdays) * 100`

## 10. **Human Capital Risk**
   - **Description:** Involves assessing risks related to human capital, such as skill shortages, leadership gaps, and potential high-impact resignations.
   - **Risk Factors:** Skill gaps, leadership readiness, employee turnover potential, and relationship dynamics within teams.

Each of these metrics not only helps in evaluating HR functions but also aligns HR strategies with business objectives, demonstrating the tangible impact of HR on the organization's bottom line.
