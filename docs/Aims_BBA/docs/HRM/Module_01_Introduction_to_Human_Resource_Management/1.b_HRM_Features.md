## 1. People Oriented
HRM focuses primarily on people, ensuring that all HR processes and initiatives consider the human aspect first and foremost. For example, an HR team might organize wellness programs like yoga sessions and mental health workshops to support employees' well-being, acknowledging that a healthy workforce is more engaged and productive.

## 2. Employee Oriented
HRM aims to enhance the work experience for employees, making sure their workplace is conducive to success and satisfaction. For instance, after receiving feedback that the office environment is too noisy, HR could introduce quiet zones where employees can work without disturbances, thus directly responding to employee needs.

## 3. Gives Opportunities
A significant role of HRM is to facilitate career growth and development for employees. This can be seen in actions such as establishing a leadership development program that identifies and nurtures potential leaders within the organization, preparing them for future managerial roles.

## 4. Decision Oriented
HRM utilizes data to inform decisions, ensuring that choices are based on evidence and can lead to better outcomes. An example would be analyzing turnover rates and employee feedback to understand the reasons behind employee dissatisfaction and then implementing specific policies to address these issues.

## 5. Development Oriented
This feature emphasizes the continuous development of both individual employees and organizational capabilities. For example, HRM might roll out annual training for new technologies or methodologies that are becoming important in the industry, ensuring that the organization remains competitive and employees' skills are up-to-date.

## 6. Individual Focus
HRM pays attention to individual employee needs, recognizing that each employee has unique circumstances and contributions. Personalized onboarding plans for new hires are a great example, where each new employee receives training tailored to their specific role and existing skills, along with regular one-on-one meetings to address any concerns and ensure a smooth integration into the company.

## 7. Continuous Function
HRM is not a one-time event but a continuous process of managing and optimizing the workforce. For example, HR might implement ongoing performance management where feedback is not just an annual event but a regular part of the work routine, allowing for continuous improvement and immediate problem-solving.

## 8. Future Oriented
HRM looks ahead to anticipate future trends and needs. This might involve strategic workforce planning where HR evaluates future industry trends, the company's business trajectory, and demographic changes within the workforce to ensure that the organization is prepared for what's next.

## 9. Universal
Every organization, regardless of size or industry, requires HRM to some degree. In a small startup, this might manifest as the founders conducting weekly informal meetings to discuss each team member's workload and well-being, thus performing basic HR functions even without a dedicated HR department.
