# Common Size Financial Statements

Common Size Financial Statements are used in financial analysis to allow for easy comparisons between periods or between companies by converting numbers into percentages. This normalization of financial data helps stakeholders understand the structure of a business's finances without being skewed by the absolute size differences.

## Purpose of Common Size Statements

Common Size Statements are particularly useful in analyzing the proportion of each line item relative to a total figure, which can be total assets for the balance sheet or total sales for the income statement. This makes trends more apparent and comparison between companies more straightforward, regardless of their size.

## Common Size Balance Sheet

A Common Size Balance Sheet expresses each item on the balance sheet as a percentage of total assets. This allows analysts to determine what proportion of a company's resources is made up of each specific asset, liability, or equity class.

### Example of a Common Size Balance Sheet

| Account Item             | As of Year 1 (%) | As of Year 2 (%) |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Assets**               |                  |                  |
| Cash and Cash Equivalents| 10%              | 12%              |
| Total Assets             | 100%             | 100%             |
| **Liabilities**          |                  |                  |
| Long-Term Debt           | 24%              | 20%              |
| Total Liabilities        | 60%              | 56%              |
| **Equity**               |                  |                  |
| Retained Earnings        | 40%              | 44%              |
| Total Equity             | 40%              | 44%              |
