# Introduction to Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis is a powerful tool used in financial accounting to help business stakeholders, including managers, investors, and analysts, understand the financial health of a company. By expressing the relationships between different financial statement items, ratio analysis provides insights into a company's performance and financial situation.

## Purpose of Ratio Analysis

The primary purpose of ratio analysis is to identify aspects of a company's financial stability, efficiency, and profitability by using data from their financial statements such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

## Types of Ratios

### 1. **Liquidity Ratios**
   - Assess a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations without raising external capital.
   - Examples: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio.

### 2. **Solvency Ratios (Capital Structure Ratios)**
   - Evaluate a company's capacity to sustain operations indefinitely by examining its debt levels relative to its assets and equity.
   - Examples: Debt to Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio.

### 3. **Profitability Ratios**
   - Measure how effectively a company can generate profit relative to sales, assets, equity, and other factors.
   - Examples: Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets.

### 4. **Efficiency Ratios (Activity Ratios)**
   - Indicate how well a company uses its assets to generate income.
   - Examples: Inventory Turnover Ratio, Receivables Turnover Ratio.

### 5. **Market Prospect Ratios**

## Limitations of Ratio Analysis

While ratio analysis is a crucial part of financial analysis, it has its limitations, including:
