# Establishing Distribution Channels

## Selecting Distributors
- **Guideline**: Choose distributors based on their ability to develop markets rather than merely having a few good customer contacts.
  - **Example**: Select a distributor with a strong network and proven track record in market development rather than one with limited but high-quality contacts. For instance, a distributor who has successfully introduced new products in the Asian market could be preferable for launching innovative products in similar markets.
  
- **Strategy**: Treat local distributors as long-term partners, not just as temporary solutions for market entry.
  - **Example**: Instead of using distributors merely to gain initial access, companies like Toyota engage in building capacity and offering extensive training to their distributors, ensuring a long-term commitment and alignment with the brandâ€™s standards.

## Working with Channel Intermediaries

### Commitment and Support
- **Objective**: Facilitate market entry by investing resources such as capital, managerial expertise, and effective marketing strategies.
  - **Example**: A tech company entering the European market might invest in local advertising campaigns, tailored to the regional audience, and send experienced managers to oversee the setup.

### Control and Reporting
- **Guideline**: Maintain control over the marketing strategy from the start and ensure that distributors provide detailed market and financial performance data.
  - **Example**: Coca-Cola maintains brand consistency by closely monitoring its global marketing campaigns and requiring regular reporting from its bottlers and distributors on sales volume, market reach, and promotional activities.

### Building Network Links
- **Objective**: Encourage collaboration among national distributors to leverage collective strengths and insights.
  - **Example**: An FMCG company might organize annual meetings with all its distributors to share best practices, discuss market trends, and coordinate marketing efforts across different regions.

## Types of Channel Intermediaries
