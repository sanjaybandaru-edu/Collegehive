There are several types of sales promotion that businesses can use to increase sales and revenue. Some examples of sales promotion include:

* Discounts: Discounts are a common type of sales promotion that businesses use to encourage customers to make a purchase. Discounts can take many forms, such as percentage discounts, dollar-off discounts, or buy-one-get-one-free offers. For example, a clothing retailer may offer a 20% discount on all items in-store to encourage customers to make a purchase.
* Coupons: Coupons are another type of sales promotion that businesses use to encourage customers to make a purchase. Coupons can be distributed through various channels, such as newspapers, magazines, or online.

* Contests and sweepstakes: Contests and sweepstakes are a type of sales promotion that businesses use to generate excitement and interest in their products or services. Contests and sweepstakes can take many forms, such as photo contests, essay contests, or prize drawings. For example, a travel agency may hold a contest for a free vacation package to encourage customers to book their next trip with them.
* Samples and trials: Samples and trials are a type of sales promotion that businesses use to introduce customers to their products or services. Samples and trials can take many forms, such as free samples, trial subscriptions, or free consultations.
