A product encompasses goods, services, or ideas, featuring a mix of tangible and intangible attributes that together deliver value to a buyer or user.

On the other hand, intangible attributes include aspects like the status associated with owning the product, the service commitment from the manufacturer, and the brand's reputation or mystique, which play a crucial role in adding value.
