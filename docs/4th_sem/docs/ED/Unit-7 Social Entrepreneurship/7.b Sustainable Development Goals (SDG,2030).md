The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a global agenda adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, part of a broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These goals are designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all" by the year 2030. The SDGs address the global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.
