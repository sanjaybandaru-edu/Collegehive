The project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. These stages help manage the project efficiently, track progress, and ensure that the project objectives are met on time and within budget. Here's an overview of each phase:

## Phase 1: Initiation
Initiation is the project kick-off phase. Key stakeholders are identified, the project's goals are outlined, and feasibility is assessed. This phase is crucial for defining the project at a broad level and establishing a project charter.

## Phase 2: Planning
The planning phase lays the foundation for the project. Detailed plans are created to guide team members through the execution phase. This includes detailing all the work, how it will be done, and the resources needed to meet project goals.

## Phase 3: Execution
The execution phase is where the project plan is put into action. It's all about getting the work done, coordinating people and resources, and completing the deliverables to achieve the project objectives.

## Phase 4: Monitoring
Monitoring goes hand-in-hand with the execution phase. It's about tracking the project’s progress to ensure that everything is aligned with the project management plan and that the project stays on track to meet its objectives.

## Phase 5: Closure
The closure phase concludes the project by wrapping up all activities. Documentation is handed over, final deliverables are released, contracts are terminated, and all stakeholders are informed that the project is complete.

Each phase is integral to the project’s success, with distinct objectives and outcomes that lead to the project's completion.
