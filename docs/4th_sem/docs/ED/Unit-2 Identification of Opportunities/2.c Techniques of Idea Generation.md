**1. Brainstorming:** 
- A quantitative technique focusing on generating a large number of ideas in a group setting.
- Emphasizes quantity over quality, encourages rapid idea generation without critique, fostering a "no bad ideas" environment.

**2. Reverse Brainstorming:**
- Focuses on identifying potential failures or problems to reverse-engineer solutions.
- Easier to critique and find flaws in plans, which are then used to find successful strategies.

**3. Brainwriting:**
- An introvert-friendly method where participants write down ideas silently before sharing.
- Encourages independent thought, followed by collaborative exploration of ideas written down by participants.

**4. Attribute Listing:**
- Breaks down problems into smaller parts to explore alternative solutions.
- Effective for incremental innovations, focusing on detailed aspects of a product/service.

**5. Free Association:**
- Develops new ideas through a chain of word associations related to the problem.
- Builds semantic relationships between words and the problem to find creative solutions.

**6. Forced Relationship:**
- Combines unrelated concepts to generate unique ideas.
- Encourages imaginative thinking by merging different ideas, useful for creating innovative products.

**7. Gordon Method:**
- Generates ideas when participants are initially unaware of the exact problem.
- Starts with a general concept, gradually leading to specific ideas and revealing the problem later for targeted solutions.

**8. Parameter Analysis:**
- Focuses on identifying and analyzing key variables in a situation to create new ideas.
- Involves detailed analysis of variables to understand their importance and influence on solutions.
