# Creativity & Innovation

## Creativity
Creativity is a characteristic that enables a person to generate new ideas, alternatives, solutions, and possibilities in a unique and different manner. It involves the ability to conceive something unpredictable, original, and unique, characterized by expressiveness, excitement, and imagination. Creativity is a reflection of a person's ability to think beautifully under any given circumstance. It is not inherent but can be developed through continuous learning and understanding with a rare and exclusive perception. Creativity is essentially a brainstorming and mind-boggling activity that requires thinking beyond one's imagination to unveil something previously hidden.

## Innovation
Innovation refers to the application of new ideas that create value for businesses, governments, and society. It represents a better and smarter way of doing anything, which could include the introduction of new technology, a new product line or segment, a new production method, or an improvement in an existing product. Innovation, closely tied to creativity, involves putting creative ideas into action, aiming for positive outcomes. It marks the process of doing something better for the first time that has not been done before by any entity, thereby bringing a new edge to performance and productivity. Innovation can be evolutionary or revolutionary.
