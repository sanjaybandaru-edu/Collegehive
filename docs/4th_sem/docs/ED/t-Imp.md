    **Background and Contribution:** Anshu Gupta founded Goonj, a non-governmental organization based in India, with a unique focus on clothing as a basic but often overlooked need. Recognizing that clothing is not just a need but a matter of dignity, Goonj addresses this by turning urban excess into a tool for rural development across 23 states in India. 

    **How It Works:** The innovative model of Goonj revolves around collecting unused or excess clothing from urban areas, which is then processed and repackaged to be used as a resource for the rural poor. This not only helps in clothing the needy but also reduces waste. Beyond clothing, Goonj has expanded its activities to include other essential items such as utensils, furniture, and school materials.

    **Significance:** The significance of Anshu Gupta’s work lies in his approach to treat cloth not as charity but as a currency for development. People in rural areas receive clothes in exchange for community work, such as building bridges, digging wells, or cleaning ponds. This has led to a significant improvement in rural infrastructure, besides addressing the clothing crisis. Anshu Gupta's work has earned him the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2015, often considered Asia's Nobel Prize, recognizing his approach to enhancing the dignity and self-esteem of the poor.
