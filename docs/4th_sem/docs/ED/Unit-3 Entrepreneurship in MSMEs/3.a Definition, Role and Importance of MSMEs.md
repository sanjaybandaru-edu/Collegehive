# Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)

## Definition

MSMEs are categorized based on various factors such as investment in plant and machinery, turnover, and the number of employees. The specific criteria can vary by country but generally include:

- **Micro Enterprises**: Businesses with a minimal number of employees, a small amount of capital investment, and turnover. These often operate as sole proprietorships or family businesses.

- **Small Enterprises**: Companies larger than micro enterprises with a limited number of employees and moderate levels of turnover and capital.

- **Medium Enterprises**: Larger than micro and small enterprises, with higher turnover and investment, but not large enough to dominate their sectors.
