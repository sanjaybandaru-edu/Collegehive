# Internet Of Things ( IoT )

  - The networking of physical items with electronics integrated into their structure in order to perceive and communicate with one another and the outside world is known as the Internet of Things (IoT).
  - Internet of things , is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
  - IoT-based technologies will provide higher quality services and essentially transform how people live their daily lives in the future years. IoT is widely established in a number of categories, including gene therapies, smart homes, smart cities, smart power, and medical advancements. 
  - The Internet of Things (IOT) is a network of connected objects, including computers, digital and mechanical machinery, items, animals, and people with unique IDs. and the capacity to send the data over a network that calls for communication between people or between people and computers.
  - Example - Wearable technologies are One of the most common Internet of Things examples is smartwatches. Wearable IoT technology like Fitbits and Apple Watches connect to other devices (like your smartphone) to share data. They typically also connect to the internet to track GPS locations.

    ## How does IoT work
    By connecting to an IoT gateway , which serves as a IoT hub where IoT devices can send data, IoT devices can share the sensor data they collect. The data can also be delivered to an edge device for preliminary evaluation before being shared.

    Local data analysis lowers the amount of data transferred to the cloud, resulting in less bandwidth being used.These gadgets occasionally interact with other similar devices and exchange information, acting upon the information received. While individuals can engage with the devices to set them up, give them instructions, or retrieve the data, the gadgets do the majority of the work without human participation.

    The particular Internet of Things applications that are implemented heavily influence the connectivity, networking, and communication protocols utilized with these web-enabled devices.

     Additionally, IoT may leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to help make data collection procedures more dynamic and straightforward.

## Why is IoT important 
   
   The internet of things helps people live and work smarter, as well as gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, IoT is essential to business.

   IoT, which provides smart home automation devices, is crucial to business. It gives businesses a real-time glimpse into the inner workings of their systems, offering insights into anything from machine performance to supply chain and logistics operations.

  With the use of IoT, machines can finish laborious jobs without assistance from humans. Businesses can improve service delivery, save labour costs, eliminate waste, and automate procedures. IoT provides insight into customer transactions and lowers the cost of manufacturing and delivery of goods.

  One of the most significant technologies is the Internet of Things (IoT), which is developing as more companies see how connected devices may help them stay competitive.

  ## Advantages of IoT 

  **1.** It can help make mobile phone-based home and city control smarter. It provides personal protection and strengthens security.
  
  **2.** 	transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money; 
  
  **3.** Efficient use of electricity is achieved through the direct connection and communication of electric devices, such cell phones, with controller computers. Consequently, there won't be any needless usage of electrical equipment.
  
  **4.** Automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention.
 
  
  ## Disadvantages of IoT 
  
  **1.** Hackers might be able to enter the system and take personal data. With so many devices connected to the internet, there's a chance that our personal data will be exploited.
  
  **2.** With the complexity of systems, there are many ways for them to fail. We lose control of our lives—our lives will be fully controlled and reliant on technology.
  
  **3.** 	Since there's no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it's difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.
  
  **4.** As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.
