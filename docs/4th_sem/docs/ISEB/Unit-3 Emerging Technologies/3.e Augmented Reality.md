## Virtual Reality (VR)
- **Definition**: A computer-generated representation of another universe or reality, often experienced through 3D movies, virtual tours, and video games.
- **Usage**: Beyond gaming and entertainment, VR is applied in training, education, and science to create immersive simulations.
- **How It Works**: VR simulates vision using a headset that blocks the real world, with graphics rendered via an HDMI cable connected to a PC or mobile. It employs goggles, speakers, and wearables for a full sensory experience, including visual, audio, and haptic feedback.

## Augmented Reality (AR)
- **Definition**: A technology blending digital elements with the real world, enhancing physical environments with digital content.
- **Usage**: AR is used in applications like score overlays on live sports, and 3D images in physical spaces.
- **How It Works**: Utilizing computer vision, mapping, and depth tracking, AR overlays digital content onto the real world as viewed through devices like smartphones.

## Difference between AR and VR

| Feature                        | Virtual Reality (VR)                          | Augmented Reality (AR)                        |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Environment                    | Entirely immersive virtual environment        | Enhances real scene with digital elements     |
| Sensory Control                | Controls the visual senses                    | Keeps user aware of the real environment      |
| Reality Composition            | 75% virtual, 25% real                         | 25% virtual, 75% real                         |
| Bandwidth Requirement          | At least 50 Mbps for full immersion           | Up to 100 Mbps for partial immersion          |
| Hardware                       | Requires VR headset                           | No headset required                           |
| User Interaction with Reality  | Isolated from real world                      | Interacts with virtual items in the real world|
| Application                    | Primarily gaming and fictional realities      | Enhances both real and virtual worlds         |
| Level of Immersion             | Complete cutoff from outside world            | Enhances physical world without isolation     |

**VR's Goal**: To create completely immersive fictional experiences.

**AR's Goal**: To augment the real world with digital enhancements for practical applications, such as turning a windshield into a head-up display for driving.

Both technologies aim to enhance user experiences but differ significantly in application and user interaction with the real world.
