# Trends in Information Systems

Information systems have seen swift advancement. Modern handheld devices now surpass the computing power of those used for the moon landing in 1969. The Internet has opened up global access, enabling unprecedented communication and collaboration. This section explores present trends and anticipates future developments. Consider how leveraging these technological advancements could offer you a competitive edge in your future career as you delve into this topic.

Core functions like transaction processing and record-keeping remain vital. However, today's IS offer greater integration and connectivity, enhancing the flexibility and strategic capabilities of businesses. Future systems aim to further increase the speed and reach of business operations, ensuring tighter integration and greater adaptability. From the 1960s onwards, the evolution of information systems (IS) has significantly transformed how businesses operate and make decisions:

- 1960s: IS were mainly used for basic tasks like transaction processing and record-keeping, eventually evolving to generate reports for management, giving rise to Management Information Systems (MIS).
- 1970s: The limitations of MIS in meeting management's decision-making needs led to the development of Decision Support Systems (DSS), offering more personalized and interactive decision-making support.
- 1980s: This era saw the emergence of end-user computing, allowing employees to use computing resources directly for their job needs. Executive Information Systems (EIS) were developed to provide top executives with easy access to critical information. The decade also marked the beginning of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.
- Late 1980s and 1990s: Strategic Information Systems (SIS) emerged, integrating technology deeply into business processes to gain competitive advantages. The introduction of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems unified various business functions, improving data integration and decision-making.
- Recent developments: Business Intelligence (BI) has become a key component, focusing on data analysis for strategic decisions. The growth of the internet and global networks has further shifted IS roles towards supporting e-business and e-commerce, making IS a strategic resource in organizations.
