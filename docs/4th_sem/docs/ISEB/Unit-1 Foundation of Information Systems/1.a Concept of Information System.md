# Concept of Information System

An **information system** is a structured arrangement of components that collects, processes, stores, and disseminates information to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in an organization. Information systems harness information about significant entities, such as people, places, and things, within the organization or the surrounding environment. 

 # Data vs Information

Understanding the difference between data and information is crucial because both terms are frequently used :
## Data

Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures that are collected from various sources. Data in itself does not carry any specific meaning. It is a collection of facts, measurements, or observations that are often in a form that is difficult to interpret or use directly. Examples of data include:

- Numbers recorded from measurements
- Words and descriptions
- Images and sounds


## Information

When data is analyzed and interpreted to reveal trends, patterns, or insights, it becomes information. Information is data made useful and actionable. Examples of information include:

- A report on the average temperature of a city over a month, derived from daily temperature readings (data).
- Sales figures analyzed to show the most popular product for a given period.
- A list of recommendations based on analysis of user behavior data.
