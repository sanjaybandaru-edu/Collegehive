# Information system activities 

The activities of an information system encompass a series of steps or functions that are designed to collect, process, store, and distribute information. Activities of information system enable organizations to make data-driven decisions, enhance operational efficiencies, and support various business processes. These activities form the backbone of any information system, ensuring that data flows seamlessly from collection to the delivery of actionable insights to end-users. The input stage ensures that data captured is accurate and complete, while the processing stage transforms this raw data into valuable information. The output stage then delivers this information in a user-friendly format, whereas storage ensures that data is safely retained and easily accessible. Finally, the control of system performance guarantees that the information system operates efficiently and effectively, meeting the needs of its users and the organization as a whole.
The major activities of information system are :
  

## 1. Input of Data Resource

  The input activity involves capturing data about business transactions and other events, preparing them for processing. This includes data entry tasks like recording and editing, ensuring data is accurately captured. Data is often recorded on physical mediums or entered directly into computer systems and may undergo various editing activities for accuracy before being stored in a machine-readable format for processing.

## 2. Processing of Data into Information

  During this stage, data undergoes processing activities such as calculating, comparing, sorting, classifying, and summarizing. These processes transform raw data into meaningful information by organizing, analyzing, and manipulating the data. Maintaining the quality of stored data through continual updating and correcting is also a critical part of this activity.

## 3. Output of Information Products

 The output activity disseminates information in various forms to end-users. The aim is to produce appropriate information products like messages, reports, forms, and graphic images, which can be delivered through video displays, audio responses, paper products, or multimedia. This stage ensures that end-users have access to the information they need in a format that is most useful to them.

## 4. Storage of Data Resource

  Storage is a fundamental component of information systems, where data and information are organized and retained for later use. Similar to how text material is organized, stored data is structured into fields, records, files, and databases to facilitate easy retrieval and processing when required by system users.

## 5. Control of System Performance

 Controlling the performance of the information system involves monitoring and producing feedback about its input, processing, output, and adherence to performance standards. When discrepancies or inefficiencies are identified, adjustments are made to the system to ensure the production of accurate and appropriate information products for end users.
