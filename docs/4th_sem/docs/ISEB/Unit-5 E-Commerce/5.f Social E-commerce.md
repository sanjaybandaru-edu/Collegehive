# Social E-Commerce
Social commerce involves selling products directly on social media platforms. This innovative approach to e-commerce enables the entire shopping experience—from product discovery and research to checkout—to occur within a social media platform. Known also as "social shopping," this method leverages the influence of social interactions and recommendations to drive sales.



Social e-commerce transforms traditional shopping by embedding the purchasing process directly into social media experiences. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook allow users to shop without leaving the app, facilitating a seamless transition from product discovery to purchase. This integration is typically achieved through:
