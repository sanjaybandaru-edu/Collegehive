It simplifies the development of mobile applications and the integration of mobile computing by hiding the complexities of mobile environments.
Enables smoother device-to-device interaction and facilitates the integration of mobile applications with enterprise systems.

## 4. Wireless Networks

Wireless networking involves connecting devices without physical cables, which is essential for mobile communications.
Common in both personal and professional settings, wireless networks eliminate the need for costly cable installations and provide flexibility in network setup and expansion.

## 5. Wired Networks

 Also known as wireline communication, this involves the use of physical cables to connect devices.
 Includes telephone networks, cable television, internet access, and fiber-optic communication.
 Most wired networks use Ethernet cables to transfer data, providing a stable and often faster connection compared to wireless options.

## 6. Host Computers

A host computer, in network terminology, refers to any computer or device that communicates with other hosts on a network.
