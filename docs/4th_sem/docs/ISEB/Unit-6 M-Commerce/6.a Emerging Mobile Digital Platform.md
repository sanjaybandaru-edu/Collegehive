# The Emerging Mobile Digital Platform

As the landscape of computing shifts towards network-based applications and services, new mobile digital platforms are emerging as the primary method of accessing the Internet. This trend is not just prevalent in the U.S. but is a global phenomenon, with portable devices like netbooks and smartphones overtaking traditional desktops and laptops.

## Transition to Mobile Access

In the coming years, it is expected that the predominant means of internet access will be through mobile devices rather than conventional PCs. This shift will naturally extend to e-commerce, where mobile platforms are becoming the primary avenue for both consuming and delivering services and products. The convenience, portability, and increasing capability of mobile devices make them the preferred choice for internet access:

- **Portability and Accessibility**: Mobile devices offer unmatched convenience and portability compared to traditional desktops and laptops, enabling users to access the internet from anywhere at any time.
- **Increased Capability**: Modern smartphones and netbooks are equipped with advanced computing abilities and connectivity that rival traditional PCs, making them suitable for a variety of tasks including complex e-commerce transactions.

## Smartphones: A Disruptive Technology

Smartphones represent a disruptive technology that has significantly altered the landscape of personal computing and e-commerce. By integrating advanced computing capabilities within a portable device, smartphones have introduced a major paradigm shift:

- **Processor and Software Shift**: Unlike traditional PCs, which are predominantly powered by Intel processors, smartphones utilize a variety of other processors. This diversification challenges the long-standing dominance of Intel in the PC market.
- **Operating System Variance**: The operating system landscape in smartphones is also markedly different. While Microsoft's operating systems have been a staple in the PC sector, they hold a much smaller share in the mobile market, particularly in smartphones where they are used by only 12% of devices, primarily in Asia.

## Impact on E-Commerce and Computing

The rise of mobile platforms is transforming the e-commerce sector by changing how products and services are accessed and delivered. Businesses are increasingly developing mobile-friendly services and applications to cater to this growing user base. Additionally, the shift challenges established monopolies in the computing industry:

- **Challenge to Established Players**: The dominance of companies like Intel and Microsoft is being challenged by mobile technologies. This has led to increased competition and innovation in the market.
- **New Market Opportunities**: The proliferation of mobile devices opens up new avenues for e-commerce and online businesses, fostering new strategies for customer engagement and service delivery.
