# Payment Systems

As mobile technology continues to evolve, an increasing number of consumers are adopting mobile payment options. Future Market Insights projects a significant growth in mobile payments, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 39% from 2015 to 2020. This trend highlights the importance for businesses to integrate mobile payment solutions to attract new customers and retain existing ones.



## Types of Mobile Payment Systems

### 1. Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are becoming the most popular form of mobile payments. 
They often utilize NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to enable the "tap-to-pay" feature, allowing users to make contactless payments. Additionally, users can preload these wallets with funds and use them for online transactions, providing a convenient and secure payment method without the need to enter payment details for every transaction.

### 2. Direct Mobile Billing

This payment method is widely used in regions where carrier billing and postpaid plans dominate.
When a customer makes a purchase, the amount is directly charged to their mobile phone bill. This method offers simplicity and ease, as it does not require the input of banking details at the point of sale.

### 3. Mobile Phone as a Credit Card Terminal

Mobile devices can now function as credit card terminals, enabling merchants to swipe or tap credit cards to accept payments directly.
This method is particularly beneficial for small business owners as it offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional EFTPOS machines. It is noted for its speed and security, reducing transaction fees and hardware costs for merchants.

### 4. Mobile Web-based Payment

This method involves making payments via the internet, either through web pages optimized for mobile browsers or through dedicated applications installed on the mobile device.
It allows consumers to easily complete transactions on the go, using their mobile device's internet connection to access their payment profiles and complete purchases securely.
