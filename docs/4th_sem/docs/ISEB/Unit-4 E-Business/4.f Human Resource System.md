## HRM and Internet

The integration of Human Resource Management (HRM) with the Internet has revolutionized how companies manage their workforce, recruit talent, and interact with employees. This shift towards digital HRM harnesses the vast capabilities of the Internet to streamline processes, enhance communication, and improve operational efficiencies. Hereâ€™s a deeper look into how the Internet has influenced HRM.

**1. Online Recruitment**

Online recruitment has transformed the traditional hiring process. Companies utilize various internet platforms, including job boards like Monster.com, Indeed, and LinkedIn, to post vacancies and attract candidates. This method broadens the reach to potential applicants, making it possible to quickly fill positions with qualified candidates from a larger pool.

- **Job Boards and Career Websites:** Platforms like CareerBuilder and Glassdoor not only list jobs but also provide company reviews and salary benchmarks, which help candidates make informed decisions.

- **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS):** These are specialized software used to handle recruitment needs. An ATS can automatically sort, rank, and track candidates, making the hiring process more efficient.

**2. Employee Training and Development**

The Internet has made it feasible to deliver training and development programs online, vastly expanding the accessibility of such resources for employees globally.

- **E-Learning Platforms:** Tools like Coursera, Udemy, and company-specific learning management systems (LMS) offer a range of courses that employees can access remotely.

- **Webinars and Virtual Workshops:** These allow real-time interaction with trainers and peers, which is essential for collaborative learning and engagement.

**3. Performance Management**:

Modern HRM utilizes the Internet to streamline performance management processes through online systems that allow for continuous feedback, goal setting, and performance tracking.

- **Continuous Feedback Tools:** Platforms like 15Five or Lattice enable managers and peers to provide real-time feedback, enhancing personal development and engagement.

- **Performance Review Systems:** Automated systems facilitate more frequent and systematic performance evaluations, moving away from the traditional annual review cycle.
