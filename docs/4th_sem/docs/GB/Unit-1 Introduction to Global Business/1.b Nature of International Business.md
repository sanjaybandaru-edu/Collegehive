# NATURE OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS (IB)

## Globalization
Globalization represents an attitude of mind - it is a mindset that views the entire world as a single market. This perspective transcends traditional boundaries and focuses on global opportunities, aiming to leverage resources and markets across the world for optimal benefits.

## International Trade and International Marketing

Initially, producers exported products to nearby countries, expanding over time to more distant markets. This gradual extension beyond mere trade has evolved into what we now understand as International Business.

### From International Marketing to International Business

A true global company views the entire world as a single market, embodying a vision that seeks to:

- **Source raw material** wherever they are cheapest.
- **Manufacture** wherever in the world it is most cost-effective.
- **Sell** in markets where prices are highest.
- **Raise finance** globally.
- **Forge international strategic alliances.**
- To manage these complexities, **hire the best talent** from all over the world.

This approach, highlighted by the strategy of Arvindh Mills, emphasizes efficiency and optimization in every aspect of business operations, from production to human resources.
