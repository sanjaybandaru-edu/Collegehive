## Hypothetical Example

Imagine a technology company, TechGlobal, looking to expand its operations into Southeast Asia. TechGlobal manufactures innovative home automation systems and wants to leverage the growing middle-class market in the region. The company evaluates different modes of entry to determine the best approach.

### Scenario Analysis

- **Exporting**: Offers low risk, but might face high import tariffs and competition.
- **Licensing**: Not ideal due to the high value of TechGlobal's proprietary technology and the risk of creating competitors.
- **Franchising**: Not applicable, as TechGlobal is not in the service industry.
- **Joint Ventures**: Could provide local market knowledge and share investment costs, but might limit control over operations.
- **Mergers & Acquisitions**: Could offer immediate market access but requires significant investment and poses integration challenges.
- **Turnkey Projects**: Not relevant, as TechGlobal is not exporting infrastructure capabilities.
- **Contract Manufacturing**: Could lower production costs but risks losing control over the manufacturing quality of high-tech products.
- **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**: Provides full control and a strong market presence but involves high investment and risk.

### Best Mode of Entry

Given the need for control over technology and the desire for a significant market presence, **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)** appears to be the best mode of entry for TechGlobal. FDI would allow TechGlobal to establish a subsidiary in Southeast Asia, maintain control over its technology and operations, and build a strong brand presence in the local market, despite the higher risks and investment involved.

This analysis concludes that while each mode of entry has its pros and cons, FDI suits TechGlobal's strategic objectives for expansion into Southeast Asia, given its long-term commitment to and investment in the region.
