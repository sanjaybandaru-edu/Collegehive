## Advantages of Exporting

- **Limited Financial Need:** Companies can enter international markets with minimal financial resources, especially when partnering with a distributor in the host country.
- **Reduced Risk:** Gradual market entry allows companies to understand the host country’s market, culture, and customers, thereby reducing risk.
- **Motivation:** Exporting can be motivated by both proactive opportunities in the host country and reactive factors.

## Forms of Exporting

### 1. Indirect Exporting

Involves selling products, either unchanged or modified, through another domestic company to foreign markets. Example: Indian publishers selling books through domestic exporters.

### 2. Direct Exporting

Entails selling products directly in a foreign country through self-managed distribution arrangements or via a distributor in the host country. Example: Baskin Robbins exporting ice cream to Russia before establishing a local plant.

### 3. Intra-corporate Transfers

Refers to selling products to an affiliated company in another country, treated as exports in the home country and imports in the host country. Example: Hindustan Lever selling to Unilever in the USA.

## Considerations for Exporting

- **Government Policies:** Export and import regulations, financing, and foreign exchange.
- **Marketing Factors:** Brand image, distribution networks, customer responsiveness, awareness, and preferences.
- **Logistical Considerations:** Costs related to physical distribution, warehousing, packaging, transportation, and inventory.
- **Distribution Issues:** Preference for own networks or leveraging those of host country companies, like Japanese firms Sony and Hitachi using subsidiary networks.

## Export Intermediaries

Export intermediaries facilitate small companies in exporting goods through various functions:

- **Export Management Companies:** Act as the exporting firm's external export department, working on commission or taking title to goods.
- **Co-operative Societies:** Formed by domestic companies wishing to export, managing the exporting operations of its members.
- **International Trading Companies:** Engage in direct exporting and importing, purchasing goods from domestic companies to export.
- **Manufacturers’ Agents:** Commission-based agents soliciting domestic orders for foreign manufacturers.
- **Manufacturers’ Export Agents:** Similar to manufacturers’ agents, but focus on selling domestic products in foreign markets, acting as the foreign sales department.
- **Export and Import Brokers:** Bridge the gap between exporters and importers.
- **Foreign Forwarders:** Assist in the physical transportation of goods, customs documentation, and arranging transport services.
