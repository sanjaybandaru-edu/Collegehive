## Decision Factors

To determine the best entry mode, companies evaluate:

These are competitive benefits derived from controlling unique resources, both tangible and intangible, such as proprietary technologies, brand recognition, and patents.

### Location Advantages

Benefits gained from operating in a particular locale, influenced by factors like local consumer preferences, logistical efficiencies, cost advantages (land, labor, materials), political stability, and climatic conditions suitable for operations.

### Internationalization Advantages

Advantages of directly establishing operations in the host country, including better quality control, market responsiveness, operational integration, and the transfer of knowledge and practices.
