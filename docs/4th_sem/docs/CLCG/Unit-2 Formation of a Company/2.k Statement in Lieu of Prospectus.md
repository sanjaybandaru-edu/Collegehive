# Statement in Lieu of Prospectus

The Statement in Lieu of Prospectus is a document outlined under Section 70 of the Companies Act, 2013. It is issued by public companies under certain circumstances and provides crucial information on the company's securities, functioning as an alternative to the traditional prospectus.

### Purpose

A Statement in Lieu of Prospectus is typically utilized when a full prospectus is not necessary or practical. This could be when a company, already listed on the stock market, intends to offer additional securities to the public. It offers a streamlined approach, foregoing the extensive details usually found in a full prospectus and does not require the approval of securities commissions.

### Conditions for Issuance

This document is delivered to the Registrar for registration at least three days before the first allotment of shares or debentures, particularly:

- When a company opts not to issue a prospectus.
- When a company has issued a prospectus but has not proceeded with the allotment of any of the shares offered to the public.

## Contents 

The Statement in Lieu of Prospectus includes essential information such as:

1. **Company Name**: The legal name of the company.
2. **Capital Structure**: Details on nominal share capital, including the number of shares and their par value.
3. **Business Description**: An overview of the company's business operations.
4. **Management Details**: Names, addresses, descriptions, and occupations of the proposed or appointed directors, chief executive, managing agent, and secretary.
5. **Management Provisions**: Information regarding the appointment, remuneration, and voting rights of the officers of the company.
6. **Securities Information**: The number and amount of shares and debentures that have been agreed upon for issue.
7. **Vendor Details**: Names, occupations, and addresses of vendors to whom the company has paid or proposes to pay for property purchases, including the amount payable in cash, shares, or debentures.
