Understanding the distinctions between the Memorandum of Association (MOA) and the Articles of Association (AOA) is fundamental for anyone involved in the corporate sector. While both documents are crucial in the governance and operation of a company under the Companies Act, they serve different purposes and have different implications for the company's management and its relationship with the outside world.
