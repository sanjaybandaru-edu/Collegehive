The terms "Limited" and "Private Limited" signify a company's legal status of limited liability, which is a privilege granted upon incorporation under the Companies Act, 2013. Misusing these terms not only violates legal norms but also misleads stakeholders about the company's liability structure. Here, we delve into the consequences of such misuse and the statutory provisions designed to curb it, along with an exploration of the corporate veil and the roles of NCLT and NCLAT in enforcing corporate governance.

### Legal Consequences of Misuse

Companies using "Limited" or "Private Limited" without proper incorporation face significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. The Companies Act, 2013, under Section 453, prescribes fines ranging from ₹500 to ₹2,000 per day for the misuse of these terms. This aims to protect the integrity of corporate structures and the interests of the public and stakeholders by ensuring transparency in a company's liability status.

### The Corporate Veil: Principle and Exceptions

The concept of the corporate veil underlines the separation between a company and its members, treating the company as an independent legal entity. This principle, established in the landmark case of Saloman vs. Saloman & Co., facilitates commerce by limiting liability and encouraging investment. However, the law recognizes exceptions where this separation can be disregarded, known as "lifting the corporate veil." This is typically done in cases of fraud, tax evasion, or where the company acts against public policy, thereby holding individuals directly accountable for the company's actions.

### Judicial Interpretation and Lifting of the Corporate Veil

Courts have developed criteria for when to lift the corporate veil, such as in instances of fraud, improper conduct, or evasion of legal obligations. This judicial discretion ensures that the protection afforded by corporate personality does not become a tool for misuse, safeguarding against entities that might otherwise exploit the corporate structure for illegitimate purposes.

###  NCLT and NCLAT: Framework for Corporate Adjudication

The establishment of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) under the Companies Act, 2013, represents a pivotal development in India's corporate governance framework. These bodies specialize in adjudicating company law disputes, offering a streamlined and effective dispute resolution mechanism. The NCLT serves as the initial forum for such disputes, while the NCLAT provides an appellate mechanism, ensuring that decisions are subject to review and that justice is accessible and efficiently administered.
