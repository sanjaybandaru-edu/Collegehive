# Theories of Corporate Governance 

The relationship between principals, such as a company's shareholders, and agents, such as its directors, is defined by agency theory. This notion holds that the agents are employed by the company's principals to carry out tasks. The directors or managers, who act as the shareholders' agents, are given the task of managing the company by the principals. The agents are expected by the shareholders to act and decide in the principal's best interest. Conversely, it is not required for the agent to act in the principals' best interests while making judgements. The agent could give in to opportunistic behaviour and self-interest, failing to live up to the principal's expectations. The division of ownership and control is the central tenet of agency theory. According to the principle, individuals or workers must be held responsible for completing their duties and obligations. Agent priorities can be adjusted through the application of rewards and penalties.
