## What is a Corporation?

A **corporation** is a legal entity that is distinct and separate from its owners. Created by individuals, stakeholders, or shareholders, corporations are primarily set up to operate for profit. Unlike individual proprietors or partnerships, a corporation has a legal identity separate from its members, which means it can perform many activities as a natural person would.

## Characteristics of a Corporation

- **Legal Identity:** A corporation has its own legal identity, separate from its founders or shareholders, allowing it to own assets, enter into contracts, and conduct business in its own name.
- **Limited Liability:** Shareholders of a corporation generally have limited liability. This means they are not personally liable for the debts or liabilities of the corporation beyond their investment in the share capital.
- **Perpetual Existence:** Corporations continue to exist even if the ownership or management changes. This perpetual existence continues until the corporation is legally dissolved.
- **Transferability of Shares:** Shares of a corporation can be easily transferred from one individual to another, offering flexibility and liquidity to shareholders.
- **Taxation:** Corporations are taxed on their profits at the corporate level. They might also face additional taxes when profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.
