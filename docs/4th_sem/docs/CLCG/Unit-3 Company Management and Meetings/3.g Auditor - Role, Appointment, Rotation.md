# Auditor Appointment, Duties, and Term Rotation

## Qualifications of an Auditor

The Companies Act 2013, specifically Section 141, delineates the qualifications required for an individual or a firm to be appointed as an auditor of a company. Key qualifications include:

- **Chartered Accountant**: An individual must be a chartered accountant as defined by the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, to be eligible for appointment as an auditor.

- **Board of Directors**: The first auditor of a company, excluding Government companies, is appointed by the Board of Directors within 30 days from the date of incorporation of the company.
- **Members' Appointment**: If the Board fails to appoint the auditor, the company's members must appoint one within 90 days during an extraordinary general meeting (EGM).
