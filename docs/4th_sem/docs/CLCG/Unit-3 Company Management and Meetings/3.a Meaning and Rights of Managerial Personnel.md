# Meaning and Rights of Managerial Personnel

## Introduction

A company is considered an artificial person, lacking a mind or body, incapable of acting on its own. The operation and management of a company are executed through human agents such as directors, managing directors (MD) or managers, secretaries, auditors, and legal advisors. The real control lies with the elected representatives, ensuring the company's smooth functioning and decision-making processes.

## Key Managerial Personnel (KMP)

### Meaning

The term 'personnel' refers to a group of people working together rather than a single individual. Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) are the core decision-makers within a company, responsible for its operational excellence. According to **Section 2(51) of the Companies Act, 2013**, and **Accounting Standard 18 (AS-18)**, KMPs are individuals who have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing, and controlling the activities of the reporting entity. These personnel play a pivotal role in ensuring the company's objectives are met efficiently.
