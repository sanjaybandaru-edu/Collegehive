# Introduction

Disclosures in company law are crucial for ensuring transparency and providing shareholders, investors, and the public with essential information about a company's financial situation and business dealings. These regulated revelations protect stakeholder interests and aid informed decision-making, serving as a key aspect of corporate accountability. They are particularly important during significant corporate events like mergers and acquisitions, where full disclosure is necessary for fair and transparent transactions.

## Disclosures as per the Companies Act, 2013

Disclosures under the Companies Act, 2013, in India, are a legal obligation designed to promote transparency, prevent conflicts of interest, and ensure that directors act in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders.

Section 184 requires directors to disclose their interests in other entities. This involves providing a comprehensive declaration regarding their involvement with other companies, bodies corporate, firms, or associations of individuals. The disclosure is made using Form MBP-1, which includes the director's details, the entities in which they have an interest, and the specific nature of these interests. This form becomes a part of the company's official records.

Non-compliance with these disclosure requirements can result in significant penalties for both the director and the company, potentially including fines and imprisonment. The rigor of these requirements underscores the law's emphasis on transparency and ethical governance.


Additionally, disclosures extend beyond directors' interests under the Act. An extract of the annual return under section 92(3) encompasses various aspects of the company's operations and governance, such as:


- The frequency of board meetings.
- Directors' responsibility statements, which confirm adherence to various legal requirements.
- Declarations from independent directors as per Section 149(6), affirming their independence.
- Details of loans, guarantees, or investments made by the company as per Section 186.
- A report on the company's state of affairs, covering the overall health and direction of the business.
- Disclosures of transactions and contracts with related parties, which are essential for identifying potential conflicts of interest.
- Descriptions of the company's risk management policies and their implementation.
- Information on corporate social responsibility activities, demonstrating the company's commitment to societal contributions.
- The amounts proposed to be transferred to reserves and paid out as dividends, reflecting the company's financial policies.
- Data on the conservation of energy, technology absorption, and foreign exchange earnings and outgo, revealing the company's operational efficiency and international economic interactions.
