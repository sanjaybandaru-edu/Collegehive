During the liquidation of a company, auditing the liquidator's accounts is crucial to ensure compliance with legal standards and proper management of the company’s assets and liabilities. This audit is a comprehensive examination of the financial activities carried out by the liquidator.

This includes identifying mismanagement of funds or breaches of fiduciary duties, ensuring the liquidator acts in the best interests of the creditors and shareholders.

3. **Increase Transparency and Accountability**: By auditing the liquidator’s actions and decisions, transparency is maintained throughout the winding-up process. This builds trust and provides reassurance to all stakeholders involved, including creditors, shareholders, and regulatory bodies.
