### Methods of Equity Valuation
1. **Intrinsic Valuation Approach**
    - Discounted cash flow method:
        - Dividend capitalization model
        - Earnings capitalization model
2. **Relative Valuation Approach**
    - Multiplier method

### Dividend Capitalization Model
- **Basic Model**: The value of an equity share is the present value of its future stream of dividends.
- **One Period Valuation Formula**:  
  $P_0 = \frac{D_1}{1 + k_e} + \frac{P_1}{1 + k_e}$

  Where:

  - $P_0$ = Value of share today
  - $D_1$ = Expected dividend at the end of 1st year
  - $P_1$ = Expected price of the share at the end of 1st year
  - $k_e$ = Required rate of return

### Multi Period Valuation
- For holding the stock for n years:

  $P_0 = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{D_t}{(1+k_e)^t} + \frac{P_n}{(1+k_e)^n}$

### Perpetual Dividend Valuation Models
- **No Growth or Zero Growth Model**:
  $P_0 = \frac{D}{k_e}$
- **Constant Growth Model**:
  $P_0 = \frac{D_1}{k_e - g}$
  Where:

  - $D_1$ = Dividend after 1 year
  - $g$ = Expected growth in dividend (%)
