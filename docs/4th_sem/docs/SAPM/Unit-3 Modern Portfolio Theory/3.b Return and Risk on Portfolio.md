# Return and Risk of a Portfolio

## Portfolio Return

Portfolio return is the overall gain or loss achieved by a combination of investments held in an investor's portfolio over a specific period. It reflects the cumulative financial outcome of all investment activities and decisions within the portfolio.

### Components of Portfolio Return:
- **Capital Gains**: Increases in the value of the portfolio's assets.
- **Dividends and Interest Payments**: Income received from equity and debt investments respectively.
- **Foreign Exchange Gains**: Gains derived from the fluctuation in exchange rates if the portfolio holds foreign assets.

### Calculating Portfolio Return:
- **Weighted Average**: The return of each asset is weighted by its proportion in the portfolio.
- **Total Portfolio Return**:
    Portfolio Return (R_p) = ∑(w_i * r_i)

Where ( w_i ) represents the weight of each asset in the portfolio, and ( r_i ) is the return of each asset.




## Portfolio Risk

Portfolio risk refers to the potential variability in returns of a portfolio and the likelihood of losses. It is an essential concept in finance, reflecting the uncertainty and the potential for investment value to vary.

### Types of Portfolio Risk:
- **Systematic Risk**: Risk inherent to the entire market or market segment, which cannot be eliminated through diversification.
- **Unsystematic Risk**: Risk specific to a particular company or industry, which can be mitigated through diversification.

### Calculating Portfolio Risk:
- **Total Portfolio Risk**:
  Portfolio Risk (σ_p) = sqrt{ ∑(w_i^2 * σ_i^2)}

Where ( w_i ) represents the weight of each asset in the portfolio, and ( σ_i ) is the risk(standard deviation) of each asset.
