# Measurement of Return and Risk
Risk is measured by the variability of returns, the assignments of probabilities and the calculation of expected values of returns. Standard deviation is defined as the square root of the mean of the squared deviations, where deviations are measured by the difference between the outcome and the expected mean value of all values.

Standard deviation can be applied when the mean is the same. However, the coefficient of variance is the relative measure of the degree of uncertainty. Standard deviation is misleading when a comparison is to be made between two series or two projects or portfolios if they differ in size and mean. The coefficient of variation is the correct technique in such cases. The higher the coefficient of variation, the more risky is the project or portfolio.

## Rate of Return

The rate of return is calculated using the formula:
$$R_i = \\frac{(P_1 - P_0) + D_1}{P_0}$$
where:
- $$R_i$$ is the rate of return
- $$P_1$$ is the ending price
- $$P_0$$ is the beginning price
- $$D_1$$ is the dividend

## Expected Rate of Return

The expected rate of return is given by the formula:
$$\\bar{X} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i p(X_i)$$
where:
- $$\\bar{X}$$ is the expected value of return
- $$X_i$$ is the return in state $$i$$
- $$p(X_i)$$ is the probability of state $$i$$

## Risk

### Variance

Variance, a measure of risk, is calculated as:
$$\\sigma^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} [(X_i - \\bar{X})^2 p(X_i)]$$
where:
- $$\\sigma^2$$ is the variance
- $$X_i$$ is the return in state $$i$$
- $$\\bar{X}$$ is the expected value of return
- $$p(X_i)$$ is the probability of state $$i$$

### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation, which is the square root of variance, is:
$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$$
where:
- $$\\sigma$$ is the standard deviation
