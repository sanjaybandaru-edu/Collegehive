# Covariance and Correlation Coefficient

## Interactive Risk through Covariance

When two securities are held in a portfolio, the risk involved is measured by the Covariance, also known as Interactive risk.

### Covariance between securities

Covariance measures how two securities move in relation to each other:

- **Positive Covariance**: Indicates that the rates of return of two securities move in the same direction.
- **Negative Covariance**: Implies that the rates of return of two securities move in opposite directions.
- **Zero Covariance**: Suggests that the rates of return of two securities are independent of each other.

The formula for Covariance ($$cov_AB$$) between two securities A and B is given by:

where:
- $$N$$ is the number of observations.
- $$R_{At}$$ and $$R_{Bt}$$ are the rates of return for securities A and B at time $$t$$, respectively.
- $$\bar{R}_A$$ and $$\bar{R}_B$$ are the average rates of return for securities A and B, respectively.

### Coefficient of Correlation

The Coefficient of Correlation ($$œÅ$$) indicates the similarity or dissimilarity in the behavior of two variables. It is standardized covariance and gives a value between -1 and 1.

- -1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation.
- 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
- 0 indicates that the variables are uncorrelated.

The formula for the Correlation Coefficient between two securities A and B is given by:

$$
\rho_{AB} = \frac{\text{cov}_{AB}}{\sigma_A \sigma_B}
$$

where:
- $$\text{cov}_{AB}$$ is the covariance between securities A and B.
- $$\sigma_A$$ and $$\sigma_B$$ are the standard deviations of securities A and B, respectively.

The Correlation Coefficient normalizes the Covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the variables, which allows for a comparison that is independent of the units of measure.
