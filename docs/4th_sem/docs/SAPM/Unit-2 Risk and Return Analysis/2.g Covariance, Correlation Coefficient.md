# Covariance and Correlation Coefficient

## Interactive Risk through Covariance

When two securities are held in a portfolio, the risk involved is measured by the Covariance, also known as Interactive risk.

### Covariance between securities

Covariance measures how two securities move in relation to each other:

- **Positive Covariance**: Indicates that the rates of return of two securities move in the same direction.
- **Negative Covariance**: Implies that the rates of return of two securities move in opposite directions.
- **Zero Covariance**: Suggests that the rates of return of two securities are independent of each other.

The formula for Covariance (\(cov_{AB}\)) between two securities A and B is given by:


- \( cov_{AB} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{t=1}^{N}(R_{At} - \bar{R}_A)(R_{Bt} - \bar{R}_B) \){: style="font-size: 150%;"}

where:
- \( N \) is the number of observations.
- \( R_{At} \) and \( R_{Bt} \) are the rates of return for securities A and B at time \( t \), respectively.
- \( \bar{R}_A \) and \( \bar{R}_B \) are the average rates of return for securities A and B, respectively.

### Coefficient of Correlation

The Coefficient of Correlation (\( \rho \)) indicates the similarity or dissimilarity in the behavior of two variables. It is standardized covariance and gives a value between -1 and 1.

- -1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation.
- 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
- 0 indicates that the variables are uncorrelated.

The formula for the Correlation Coefficient between two securities A and B is given by:

- \( \rho_{AB} = \frac{cov_{AB}}{\sigma_A \sigma_B} \){: style="font-size: 150%;"}

where:
- \( cov_{AB} \) is the covariance between securities A and B.
- \( \sigma_A \) and \( \sigma_B \) are the standard deviations of securities A and B, respectively.

The Correlation Coefficient normalizes the Covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the variables, which allows for a comparison that is independent of the units of measure.
