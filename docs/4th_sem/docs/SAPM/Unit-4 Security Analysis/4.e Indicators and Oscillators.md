# Financial Market Oscillators

Oscillators are technical analysis tools that oscillate between two extremes. They are used to identify overbought or oversold conditions, signal potential trend reversals, and gauge momentum.

## Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

- **Calculation**: MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A 9-day EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD to trigger buy or sell signals.

### MACD Example Calculation

Suppose we have the following closing prices for a stock over 12 days:

| Day | Closing Price |
|-----|---------------|
| 1   | $10.00        |
| ... | ...           |
| 12  | $15.00        |

- **12-day EMA**: $13.00 (Hypothetical)
- **26-day EMA**: $11.00 (Hypothetical)
- **MACD**: $13.00 - $11.00 = $2.00

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Developed by J. Welles Wilder, RSI measures the speed and change of price movements.

- **Calculation**: RSI is calculated using the following formula:

```
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
```

Where RS is the average gain of up periods during the specified time frame divided by the average loss of down periods.

### RSI Example Calculation

For a 14-day period with an average gain of $0.50 and an average loss of $0.30:

- **RS**: $0.50 / $0.30 = 1.67
- **RSI**: 100 - (100 / (1 + 1.67)) = 62.5

## Rate of Change (ROC)

ROC measures the percentage change in price from one period to the next.

- **Calculation**: The ROC is calculated by dividing the current price by the price from `n` days ago, then multiplying the result by 100.

### ROC Example Calculation

If today's price is $120 and the price 12 days ago was $100:

- **ROC**: (($120 / $100) - 1) * 100 = 20%

Oscillators like MACD, RSI, and ROC provide valuable insights into market conditions, helping traders make informed decisions. By analyzing these indicators, investors can gauge the momentum, identify potential trend reversals, and spot overbought or oversold conditions in the market.


### Example Stock Data and Calculation

For a practical example, let's say we have a sample stock with the following closing prices over 12 days:

- **Day 1**: $100
- **Day 12**: $110

We'll calculate MACD, RSI, and ROC based on simplified formulas and assumptions for illustrative purposes.

1. **MACD** would require the calculation of EMAs, which involves a more complex formula, so we've provided a hypothetical example above.
2. **RSI** would need average gains and losses, which we've also simplified in the example above.
3. **ROC** is calculated as shown, indicating a 20% rate of change if the price moved from $100 to $120 over 12 days.

To perform actual calculations, you would need specific price data for each day within the period you're analyzing. These indicators require historical data to produce meaningful results, and their accuracy depends on the precision of the input data and adherence to the calculation formulas.
