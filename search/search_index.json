These decisions are influenced by a combination of internal and external factors.</p> <p>Internal Factors</p> <ul> <li> <p>Nature of Business: The type of business significantly influences financial decisions. For example, a manufacturing company may invest heavily in fixed assets, leading to a capital structure with more long-term capital. In contrast, a trading company may invest more in current assets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Size of Business: The size of a business also plays a crucial role. Large firms require substantial capital to run their operations, while small firms may require less capital and can lease some assets at a lower cost. Small or new firms often rely on larger, more established firms with a strong market presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Legal Form: The legal structure of a business impacts financial decisions. Joint organizational structures may enjoy more favorable borrowing terms than sole proprietorships or partnerships.</p> </li> <li> <p>Business Cycle: Financial managers must consider the stage of the business cycle when making decisions. Market conditions during expansion, recession, or recovery can significantly affect financial choices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ownership: The ownership structure of a company can influence decision-making. Companies with limited ownership may find it easier to make decisions in the best interests of the firm.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earnings: The stability of a company's income and the level of earnings risk play a role in financial decisions. Unstable income or high earnings risk may lead to a preference for retaining earnings to reassure shareholders. Conversely, stable income or low earnings risk may result in a more liberal dividend policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Liquidity: Companies with strong liquidity positions may adopt a more liberal dividend policy. Companies facing obligations or short-term financial commitments may opt for a conservative dividend policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Asset Composition: The composition of assets in a company's balance sheet can influence financing decisions. More fixed assets may lead to long-term financing, while a higher proportion of current assets may require short-term financing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Economic Life: The expected economic life of assets affects borrowing preferences. Companies may align borrowing terms with the expected economic life of assets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Term of Credit: The availability and terms of credit impact financial decisions. Companies consider credit terms when determining dividend payments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Management Philosophy: The financial management philosophy within an organization can affect decisions. Some financial managers prioritize liquidity over profitability, following a conservative approach, while others adopt a more aggressive approach.</p> </li> </ul> <p>External Factors</p> <ul> <li> <p>Economic Conditions: Economic conditions have a significant impact on financial decisions. During periods of economic recovery, financial managers may seek investment opportunities, whereas during economic downturns, a more cautious approach is necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Financial Markets: The state of financial markets influences decisions. Developed markets with diverse institutions and investors may lead financial managers to adopt a mixed capital structure.

Future Financial Requirements: The company's anticipated future financial needs impact its ploughing-back strategy.

Whether it's buying a car, a home, machinery, or establishing large-scale business units, bank loans offer a vast scope of financing options. Borrowers can access funds according to their creditworthiness and financial capacity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Driver of Growth: Bank loans play a crucial role in driving growth, especially for both public and private sector companies. Many businesses may not have sufficient cash flow to finance significant expansions. In a rapidly evolving economy, expansion is essential for sustained profitability. Bank loans facilitate growth acceleration by enabling companies to invest in expansion projects, such as machinery purchases. Companies can repay these loans over time, rather than waiting for years to accumulate sufficient funds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provides Capital for Daily Operations: Banks offer specialized loans designed to help companies manage their day-to-day operational capital and cash cycles. These working capital loans provide flexibility in managing debtor and creditor agreements. For example, if a company purchases goods worth USD 1000.00 with a 10-day payment term and expects to receive USD 1200.00 for the goods in 30 days, it can borrow USD 1000.00 from the bank for 20 days. The company can repay the bank after receiving the USD 1200.00 payment from the debtor. This type of loan allows companies to pay interest only for the amount borrowed and the number of days used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Better Interest Rates: Organized banking has replaced unorganized moneylending practices of the past, eliminating the exploitation of borrowers through exorbitant interest rates and unreasonable collateral demands. Bank loans are provided systematically and come with minimal interest rates, making them a cost-effective financing option compared to loans from other financial institutions such as NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies).</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexibility: Bank loans offer flexibility to borrowers, allowing them to choose the loan's duration and the amount of equated monthly installments (EMI). While the loan amount and interest rates are negotiable, borrowers can tailor the loan to meet their specific needs. For instance, an individual taking a home loan can decide whether to repay it in 5, 10, or 20 years based on their financial situation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounting &amp; Tax Advantages: Interest paid on bank loans is deductible from taxable income, providing borrowers with tax savings. This deduction can be advantageous for budgeting and planning monthly loan expenses. It's particularly beneficial for fixed-rate loans, although a simple model can be prepared for changes in floating-rate loans.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ownership Remains with Borrower: Bank loans allow companies to raise funds while retaining ownership. Unlike other methods of raising capital, such as issuing equity shares or involving venture capital, where the company may need to relinquish ownership shares, bank loans enable businesses to secure funds without sacrificing ownership stakes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cash Discount: Many creditors offer cash discounts, which can be availed of when funds are readily available for payment. Bank limits can support businesses in seizing cash discount opportunities. However, it's crucial for business owners to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to ensure that the benefits of cash discounts outweigh the interest costs associated with utilizing funds for payment.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Bank loans offer numerous advantages that cater to a variety of financial needs and situations. These merits make bank loans an essential tool for individuals and businesses seeking to achieve their goals and manage their finances effectively.</p>"},{"location":"2nd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-2%20Sources%20of%20finance%20and%20Capitalization/2.4%20Loan%20financing.html#demerits","title":"Demerits:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Additional Burden on Cost of Goods: One significant drawback of bank loans is that borrowers end up paying more than the purchase price of the product or service when they use a loan. For instance, if an individual buys a smartphone for USD 800.00 but decides to borrow USD 500.00 through a bank loan at a 10% annual interest rate, the total repayment becomes USD 550.00 (USD 500.00 principal + USD 50.00 interest). In this case, the individual paid USD 50.00 more than the product's original price. When dealing with larger loan amounts, this additional cost can become quite substantial.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security Needs and Creditworthiness: Obtaining a bank loan can be challenging unless the borrower or company has a strong credit score or valuable collateral. Banks are cautious lenders, and they extend loans primarily to borrowers who demonstrate the ability and willingness to repay. New businesses and individuals with limited credit history may find it even more difficult to secure a bank loan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partial Funding Requirement: In the case of term loans, banks often impose partial payment requirements on borrowers. This means that borrowers must contribute a portion of the total loan amount from their own funds. The percentage of partial payment can vary but may range from 10% to 40% in some cases. For example, if a company needs a USD 10,000.00 loan to purchase a new office, the bank may stipulate that the company must invest USD 1,000.00 of its own capital. If the borrower lacks sufficient funds for the partial payment, the bank may reject the loan application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strict Repayment Schedule: Banks prescribe a rigorous repayment schedule that borrowers must adhere to strictly. Failure to meet these scheduled payments can result in a reduction in the borrower's credit score and future borrowing credibility. The stringent repayment schedule can sometimes create a financial burden for borrowers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepayment Penalties and Charges: Most banks charge borrowers for repaying their loans ahead of schedule, resulting in an additional cost to the borrower. Some financial institutions impose hefty prepayment penalties and charges. Prospective borrowers are advised to thoroughly review the loan agreement to determine if it includes any prepayment penalties. If such penalties exist, borrowers should carefully assess their loan requirements and the desired loan tenure to avoid unnecessary costs.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Bank loans are a significant financial tool with the potential to facilitate growth and meet diverse financial needs.

In simpler terms, it occurs when a company's assets are overvalued compared to their actual earning potential.</p> <p>Illustration:</p> <p>For example, if a company's book value of assets is Rs. 25,00,000 (represented by a capitalization of 25,00,000, consisting of equity capital, preference capital, and debentures), but the real value of assets based on their earning capacity is only Rs. 15,00,000, there is over-capitalization in the company to the extent of Rs. 10,00,000. This means that the company's earnings are generated only from Rs. 15,00,000 worth of assets, while it has a capitalization of Rs. 25,00,000. The excess capital, in this case, represents idle funds that do not produce any benefits or profits for the company.</p> <p>Causes of Over-Capitalization:</p> <p>Several factors can lead to over-capitalization in a company:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Assets Acquired at Inflated Prices: When assets are acquired at prices significantly higher than their actual value, it results in over-capitalization. This occurs when promoters or management pay an excess price for assets that does not align with their earning capacity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Issue of Excessive Finances: Sometimes, during a favorable market sentiment, promoters may issue excessive shares or securities, leading to the infusion of more capital than the company can profitably use. This excess capital becomes non-earning and contributes to over-capitalization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Huge Borrowings at High Interest Rates: If a company borrows a substantial amount of money through debentures or loans at high-interest rates, a significant portion of its earnings may go towards interest payments, leaving little surplus for equity shareholders.

In the United States, this concept is commonly known as \"leverage.\"</p> <p>The gearing ratio measures the financial risk of a company and expresses the amount of a company's debt in terms of its equity. A higher gearing ratio indicates that a company has a larger amount of debt relative to its equity value. For example, a company with a gearing ratio of 2.0 would have twice as much debt as equity.</p> <p>The formula for calculating the capital gearing ratio is as follows:</p> <p>Capital Gearing Ratio = Common Stockholders' Equity / Fixed Cost Bearing Funds</p> <p>In this formula: - Common Stockholders' Equity includes share capital, share premium, general reserves, and participatory preference shares. It represents the equity portion of the company's capital structure. - Fixed Cost Bearing Funds consist of long-term bonds, term loans, and preference shares with fixed dividend payouts. These represent the debt portion of the capital structure.</p> <p>Importance of Capital Gearing Ratio:</p> <p>The gearing ratio is a crucial metric for assessing a company's financial health and risk. It helps investors and analysts understand how a company uses debt to enhance its capital. Here are some key points regarding the importance of the gearing ratio:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Financial Risk Assessment: The gearing ratio provides insights into the financial risk or solvency risk of a company. It measures the impact of debt on the capital structure and evaluates the level of financial risk associated with additional debt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Efficiency: It assesses how efficiently a company utilizes its capital structure by balancing debt and equity. Debt can offer cost advantages due to tax shields on interest payments, but it also creates committed liabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Investor Decision-Making: Investors use the gearing ratio to make informed investment decisions. A high gearing ratio may indicate higher financial risk, while a low ratio suggests a more conservative capital structure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creditworthiness: Lenders and creditors assess a company's gearing ratio to evaluate its creditworthiness. A lower gearing ratio may lead to more favorable borrowing terms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Structure Optimization: Companies can use the gearing ratio to optimize their capital structure. By adjusting the mix of debt and equity, they can lower their cost of capital and enhance shareholder value.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, the capital gearing ratio is a valuable tool for understanding how a company leverages debt in its capital structure. It aids in evaluating financial risk, optimizing capital, and making informed investment and credit decisions.</p>"},{"location":"2nd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-4%20Cost%20of%20capital%20and%20Leverages/4.0%20Fomulas.html","title":"Formulas of Cost of Capital","text":""},{"location":"2nd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-4%20Cost%20of%20capital%20and%20Leverages/4.0%20Fomulas.html#cost-of-debt-capital","title":"Cost of Debt Capital","text":"<p>Debt is of Two types - Irredeemable Debt and Redeemable Debt.where Irredeemable Debt also know as perpetual is the debt which is not to be repaid and Redeemable Debt is the debt which is to be repaid after a certain period of time.

It posits that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received.</p> <p>Importance:</p> <p>The importance of the time value of money is multifold:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Investment Decisions: TVM is crucial in making investment decisions. When investors consider various options, they look at the future value of their investments to determine which will yield the most returns over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Opportunity Cost: It helps in understanding the opportunity cost of money. Not investing or using money to its fullest potential today leads to a loss of potential earnings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inflation Impact: Money loses value over time due to inflation. TVM helps investors and savers plan for their future by considering the eroding impact of inflation on their savings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Loan and Mortgage Calculations: Lenders use the principle of TVM to determine loan payment schedules. Mortgages, car loans, and other types of loans calculate payments based on the time value of money.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Need:</p> <p>The need for understanding the time value of money arises in various contexts:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Financial Planning: For both personal finance and corporate finance, comprehending TVM is essential to ensure that savings and investments grow over time to meet future needs and goals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Budgeting: Businesses use TVM to decide whether to undertake projects or investments, considering the present value of future cash flows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pricing of Financial Instruments: The valuation of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments relies on forecasting future cash flows and discounting them to present value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Retirement Planning: TVM helps in calculating the amount needed to save today to reach a desired retirement fund.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Time Value of Money Using Table Value:</p> <p>Time value of money calculations often utilize present value (PV) and future value (FV) tables. These tables provide the factors required to calculate the present or future value of money at different interest rates and time periods.</p> <ul> <li>Present Value: To find the present value, you use a present value factor which discounts the future amount by a certain interest rate for a certain number of periods.</li> </ul> <p>\\( PV = FV \\times (1 / (1 + r)^n) \\)</p> <p>Where \\( PV \\) is the present value, \\( FV \\) is the future value, \\( r \\) is the interest rate per period, and \\( n \\) is the number of periods.</p> <ul> <li>Future Value: To find the future value, you use a future value factor which compounds the present amount at a certain interest rate for a certain number of periods.</li> </ul> <p>\\( FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n \\)</p> <p>In these formulas, the factor \\( (1 + r)^n \\) (for FV) or its reciprocal \\( (1 / (1 + r)^n) \\) (for PV) can be found in financial tables, which saves time and simplifies calculations.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a basic example:</p> <p>Suppose you have $1,000 today and can invest it at an annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years. Using a future value table, you find the factor for 5% (interest rate) at 3 years (time period), which might be around 1.158. You calculate the future value as follows:</p> <p>\\( FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n \\)</p> <p>\\( FV = $1,000 * 1.158 \\)</p> <p>\\( FV = $1,158 \\)</p> <p>Thus, the future value of $1,000 today at 5% interest over 3 years is $1,158.</p> <p>By understanding and utilizing the time value of money, individuals and businesses can make informed financial decisions, maximize their wealth, and ensure financial security over time.</p>"},{"location":"2nd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-5%20Capital%20budgeting/5.5%20capital%20budgeting%20process.html","title":"Capital Budgeting Process","text":"<p>Capital budgeting is a crucial financial management process that companies undertake to evaluate potential major investments or expenditures.

The cycle depicts the process through which a business turns its products into cash and includes the following stages:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Cash: The cycle starts with cash on hand which will be used to purchase raw materials.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounts Payable: This represents the money a company owes to its suppliers from whom it has purchased raw materials on credit. The management of accounts payable is crucial as it affects the company's cash flow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raw Materials: Purchased raw materials are the initial stage in the production process. Managing raw materials inventory efficiently ensures that the company has enough to meet production needs without tying up too much capital in inventory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Work In Progress (WIP): Raw materials are then converted into work-in-progress goods. These are goods that are in the process of being manufactured but are not yet complete. During this phase, value is added to the raw materials through labor and overhead costs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finished Goods: Once the goods are completed, they are moved to finished goods inventory, ready to be sold to customers. It's vital to manage this inventory effectively to meet sales demand without overproducing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sales: The finished goods are sold, either for cash or on credit terms. Sales on credit terms will create accounts receivable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounts Receivable: This represents the money owed by customers to the company for goods sold on credit. Efficiently managing accounts receivable ensures that the company collects its cash as quickly as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cash: The cycle completes when the accounts receivable are collected and converted back into cash.

This type of behavior is commonly observed when consumers are purchasing expensive, risky, infrequently purchased, and highly self-expressive products, such as a house, a car, or a computer. The decision-making process is extensive and involves thorough research, evaluation of alternatives, and consideration of multiple factors, such as price, quality, features, and brand reputation. Consumers engage in information gathering, consult expert opinions, and rely on personal experiences to make informed decisions.</p> <p>For example, suppose a consumer wants to buy a new laptop. He would likely spend time researching different brands, comparing specifications/features, reading customer reviews, and seeking recommendations from friends or technology experts before finalizing their purchase.</p> <p>Simply put, in complex buying behaviour, the consumer will go through different learning phases. Firstly, he will learn and develop a belief regarding the product that he wants to purchase. The belief of the consumer creates his attitude based on which he will make the final purchase decision. Therefore, the marketers of the high involvement products must ensure that they understand the information-gathering and evaluation behaviour of these customers and help them learn about the attributes of the product along with their relative importance. They can also take the help of advertisements so the customers can get answers to basic questions. </p> <ul> <li>Dissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior:</li> </ul> <p>Dissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior occurs when consumers face a high level of involvement in the purchase decision but encounter little difference among brands. This type of behavior is commonly observed when consumers are purchasing expensive, infrequent, or risky products; such as furniture, curtain material, or sofa covers/upholstery. These products face high involvement of the consumer as they are expensive and self-expressive. Also, as the perceived brand difference is not large in this case, the consumers would purchase easily and readily available products.</p> <p>For example, suppose a consumer wants to buy a portable tent for camping. For this, he will have to make a quick decision from the limited options available to him. He will make the purchase decision without doing enough research and inquiring about information from different sources about it.</p> <p>Once the purchase is made, the consumers might experience post-purchase dissonance or after-sale discomfort. It happens when the consumer notices some disadvantages of the purchased brand or hears some good things about the other brand. For such dissonance, it is essential for the marketer to provide the consumers with after-sale communications and help them feel good about their brand choices.</p> <ul> <li>Habitual Buying Behavior:</li> </ul> <p>Habitual Buying Behavior occurs when consumers face a low level of involvement in the purchase decision along with little significant brand differences. This type of behavior is commonly observed when consumers are purchasing products like salt, etc. Low involvement of consumers means that they simply reach the store and go for a brand to buy a product. If the consumer is buying a product from the same brand, it does not mean that they are loyal to the brand. It just means that the consumer is buying the product out of habit.</p> <p>For example, buying a specific brand of toothpaste, snack items, or toiletries from a particular store without much thought or consideration falls under habitual buying behavior. Consumers may choose these products based on familiarity, past positive experiences, or simply because it is part of their routine.</p> <p>The consumer behavior, in this case, does not pass through the usual belief attitude behavior sequence. Before purchasing a product, these consumers do not extensively search for information regarding the brand, evaluate the characteristics of the brand, and make weighty decisions on which brand to purchase. Instead, they just passively receive the information while watching television or reading newspapers or magazines. Also, Ad repetitions instead of creating brand conviction, create brand familiarity in the minds of consumers. Because of this, consumers do not form strong attitudes towards a brand; they just select the brand because they are familiar with it. Therefore, the marketers take help of repetitive marketing campaigns, so that consumers can remember their brand.</p> <ul> <li>Variety-Seeking Buying Behavior:</li> </ul> <p>Variety-Seeking Buying Behavior occurs when consumers exhibit a desire for new experiences, change, and novelty in their purchases. It means that when consumers face a low level of involvement but significant perceived brand differences, they undertake variety-seeking buying behavior. In such cases, the consumers switch brands more often.</p> <p>For example, a consumer chooses a namkeen brand without doing much evaluation, and then after consuming the product, evaluates it. But the consumer might pick another brand when making a purchase the next time. The reason behind this can be his urge to try something new or just out of boredom.</p> <p>Consumers engaging in variety-seeking behavior may not have strong brand loyalty and actively seek alternatives, even if they are satisfied with their current choices. They enjoy exploring different options, experimenting with new products, and deviating from their routine purchases. This behavior is more prevalent in product categories where there are numerous options and alternatives available. Besides, the marketing strategy of the products, in this case, may differ for the minor brands and the market leader. Market leaders try to encourage the habitual buying behavior of consumers by dominating shelf space, keeping the shelves fully stocked with goods, and running advertisements frequently as a reminder. However, the challenger firms encourage the variety-seeking behavior of consumers by offering them coupons, free samples, and goods at lower prices and encouraging them through advertisements to buy something new.</p>"},{"location":"2nd_sem/docs/MM/Unit-2%20Connecting%20with%20Customers/2.4%20The%20Buyer%20Decision%20Process.html","title":"Buying Decision Process","text":"<p>The Buying Decision Process is a fundamental concept in understanding consumer behavior, as it provides insights into how individuals make purchasing decisions.

Hotels provide accommodations (service) facilitated by tangible assets like rooms and furnishings.</li> <li>A Major Goods with Service: Some products include an associated service component, often as after-sales support or maintenance contracts. Copiers with maintenance agreements are an example.</li> <li>Pure Tangible Goods: Physical products with no inherent service component, such as books, soap, and toothpaste.

These included virtual currencies used in video games, online payment systems like PayPal, and digital gold currencies like E-Gold. These predecessors laid the groundwork for digital currency adoption.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bitcoin Emerges (2009): The birth of Bitcoin in 2009, with the release of its whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, marked a significant turning point. Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology, decentralized ledger maintenance, and the concept of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It gained popularity as a store of value and a medium of exchange.</p> </li> <li> <p>Altcoins (2010s): Following Bitcoin's success, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) emerged, each with unique features and use cases. Examples include Litecoin, launched in 2011, which offered faster transaction confirmation times, and Ripple (XRP), designed for cross-border payments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blockchain Expansion (2010s): The underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, found applications beyond digital currencies. Companies and organizations began exploring blockchain for supply chain management, voting systems, and more. This led to the development of blockchain ecosystems outside of cryptocurrencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) (2010s): ICOs became a popular fundraising method in the mid-2010s. New cryptocurrencies were created and sold to the public to raise capital for blockchain projects. While some ICOs were successful, others were associated with scams and regulatory challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Institutional Adoption (2020s): Cryptocurrencies gained broader acceptance among institutional investors and traditional financial institutions. Companies like Tesla and Square invested in Bitcoin, and major financial institutions explored crypto-related products and services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) (Ongoing): Central banks worldwide began exploring the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Scope of Business Banks have a limited scope of business defined by Section 6(1) of the Banking Regulation (BR) Act. NBFCs have a broader scope and can engage in activities other than financial ones. Licensing Requirements Licensing requirements for banks are stringent, and even the transfer of shareholding is controlled by the RBI. Forming an NBFC is relatively easier, but the acquisition of NBFCs is procedurally regulated and subject to approval. Major Limitations Banks cannot carry out non-banking activities. They can exercise powers of recovery under SARFAESI (Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest) and DRT (Debt Recovery Tribunal) laws. NBFCs cannot provide checking facilities, and only specific NBFCs specified by the Central Government have powers under SARFAESI or DRT laws. Major Privileges Banks have the privilege of accepting demand deposits and are subject to strict regulatory controls. Private sector banks can have up to 74% foreign investment. NBFCs, depending on their activities, can have up to 100% foreign investment. There are 18 specified activities for NBFCs. Regulations Banks are subject to stringent controls under the Banking Regulation (BR) Act and RBI Act. Controls over NBFCs are relatively less stringent than banks. SLR/CRR Requirements Banks are required to maintain Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) as per RBI regulations. NBFCs, specifically deposit-taking NBFCs (NBFC-Ds), have to maintain a certain ratio of deposits in specified securities. Non-deposit taking companies do not have this requirement. Priority Sector Lending Requirements Banks are required to allocate a certain minimum percentage of their lending to priority sectors as per RBI guidelines.

This step aims to create a comprehensive list of potential risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ranking or Evaluation of Risks: After recognizing risks, they are assessed using qualitative criteria based on factors like probability and potential impact. Risks are then ranked from highest to lowest importance, allowing businesses to focus on the most critical ones.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responding to Significant Risks: Based on the ranking, businesses develop risk management strategies:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tolerate: Risks with low probability and low potential impact may be accepted or tolerated, as the cost of mitigating them could be higher than their potential impact.</p> </li> <li> <p>Treat: Risks with moderate probability and potential impact are addressed with treatment measures to reduce potential losses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transfer: Risks with high probability and high potential impact can be transferred to third parties through methods like outsourcing or purchasing insurance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Terminate: Risks with very high probability and potential impact can be terminated by discontinuing the DFS offering or seeking new partners or vendors.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Resourcing Controls: Businesses allocate budgets to implement risk responses effectively. This step ensures that financial resources are available to support risk management strategies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reaction Planning: Developing tactical responses to address specific risks effectively. This involves creating detailed plans to execute risk mitigation actions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reporting and Monitoring Risk Performance: Regular reporting on risk performance is essential. It helps determine whether a risk has occurred, if losses have taken place, if it has occurred but has been mitigated, or if it has not occurred yet. This reporting provides insight into the effectiveness of risk management efforts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reviewing the Risk Management Framework: Periodic reviews are crucial.

Agent Density Risks:    * Insufficient Agents: If there are not enough agents or if they lack capacity, customers may face long queues or liquidity issues, leading to dissatisfaction and a potential loss of trust in the service.    * Excess Agents: Conversely, too many agents can dilute customer interactions, affecting agents\u2019 earnings and their ability to manage cash and e-money floats, leading to service unavailability.</p> <p>2. Insufficient Liquidity Risks:    * Agents must balance cash and e-money to facilitate transactions. Inadequate liquidity can result in agents being unable to fulfill cash-in or cash-out requests, damaging customer trust and the agent's business.</p> <p>3. Theft of Cash Float Risks:     - With agents handling substantial cash flows, the risk of theft is significant. This risk can be mitigated by secure cash handling procedures and services.</p> <p>4. Teller Errors Risks:    * Mistakes in transaction entry or cash handling by agents can lead to financial discrepancies, impacting both the agent and customer satisfaction.</p> <p>5. Poor Training Risks:    * Inadequate training can lead to agents being unfamiliar with the DFS platform, resulting in customer service failures and a damaged reputation for the service provider.</p> <p>6. Customer Service Mismanagement Risks:    * As frontline representatives, agents' mishandling of customer service can lead to loss of clientele, inactivity, and reputational damage.</p> <p>7. Poor Agent Selection Risks:    * Incorrectly chosen agents may not perform as required, leading to regulatory non-compliance, financial losses, and reputational risk.</p> <p>8.

These decisions are influenced by a combination of internal and external factors.</p> <p>Internal Factors</p> <ul> <li> <p>Nature of Business: The type of business significantly influences financial decisions. For example, a manufacturing company may invest heavily in fixed assets, leading to a capital structure with more long-term capital. In contrast, a trading company may invest more in current assets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Size of Business: The size of a business also plays a crucial role. Large firms require substantial capital to run their operations, while small firms may require less capital and can lease some assets at a lower cost. Small or new firms often rely on larger, more established firms with a strong market presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Legal Form: The legal structure of a business impacts financial decisions. Joint organizational structures may enjoy more favorable borrowing terms than sole proprietorships or partnerships.</p> </li> <li> <p>Business Cycle: Financial managers must consider the stage of the business cycle when making decisions. Market conditions during expansion, recession, or recovery can significantly affect financial choices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ownership: The ownership structure of a company can influence decision-making. Companies with limited ownership may find it easier to make decisions in the best interests of the firm.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earnings: The stability of a company's income and the level of earnings risk play a role in financial decisions. Unstable income or high earnings risk may lead to a preference for retaining earnings to reassure shareholders. Conversely, stable income or low earnings risk may result in a more liberal dividend policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Liquidity: Companies with strong liquidity positions may adopt a more liberal dividend policy. Companies facing obligations or short-term financial commitments may opt for a conservative dividend policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Asset Composition: The composition of assets in a company's balance sheet can influence financing decisions. More fixed assets may lead to long-term financing, while a higher proportion of current assets may require short-term financing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Economic Life: The expected economic life of assets affects borrowing preferences. Companies may align borrowing terms with the expected economic life of assets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Term of Credit: The availability and terms of credit impact financial decisions. Companies consider credit terms when determining dividend payments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Management Philosophy: The financial management philosophy within an organization can affect decisions. Some financial managers prioritize liquidity over profitability, following a conservative approach, while others adopt a more aggressive approach.</p> </li> </ul> <p>External Factors</p> <ul> <li> <p>Economic Conditions: Economic conditions have a significant impact on financial decisions. During periods of economic recovery, financial managers may seek investment opportunities, whereas during economic downturns, a more cautious approach is necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Financial Markets: The state of financial markets influences decisions. Developed markets with diverse institutions and investors may lead financial managers to adopt a mixed capital structure. Shareholder preferences in such markets may favor a liberal dividend policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Government Regulations: Government regulations play a crucial role in financial decisions. These regulations can vary from one jurisdiction to another, impacting borrowing, reporting, and other financial aspects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taxation: Tax considerations drive financial decision-making. Financial managers may adjust depreciation policies, inventory valuation methods, capital structures, and bonus distributions to minimize tax burdens and take advantage of tax exemptions.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20management/1.9.b%20Functional%20areas%20of%20financial%20management.html","title":"Functional Areas of Financial Management","text":""},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20management/1.9.b%20Functional%20areas%20of%20financial%20management.html#1-determining-financial-needs","title":"1.

Future Financial Requirements: The company's anticipated future financial needs impact its ploughing-back strategy.

Whether it's buying a car, a home, machinery, or establishing large-scale business units, bank loans offer a vast scope of financing options. Borrowers can access funds according to their creditworthiness and financial capacity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Driver of Growth: Bank loans play a crucial role in driving growth, especially for both public and private sector companies. Many businesses may not have sufficient cash flow to finance significant expansions. In a rapidly evolving economy, expansion is essential for sustained profitability. Bank loans facilitate growth acceleration by enabling companies to invest in expansion projects, such as machinery purchases. Companies can repay these loans over time, rather than waiting for years to accumulate sufficient funds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provides Capital for Daily Operations: Banks offer specialized loans designed to help companies manage their day-to-day operational capital and cash cycles. These working capital loans provide flexibility in managing debtor and creditor agreements. For example, if a company purchases goods worth USD 1000.00 with a 10-day payment term and expects to receive USD 1200.00 for the goods in 30 days, it can borrow USD 1000.00 from the bank for 20 days. The company can repay the bank after receiving the USD 1200.00 payment from the debtor. This type of loan allows companies to pay interest only for the amount borrowed and the number of days used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Better Interest Rates: Organized banking has replaced unorganized moneylending practices of the past, eliminating the exploitation of borrowers through exorbitant interest rates and unreasonable collateral demands. Bank loans are provided systematically and come with minimal interest rates, making them a cost-effective financing option compared to loans from other financial institutions such as NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies).</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexibility: Bank loans offer flexibility to borrowers, allowing them to choose the loan's duration and the amount of equated monthly installments (EMI). While the loan amount and interest rates are negotiable, borrowers can tailor the loan to meet their specific needs. For instance, an individual taking a home loan can decide whether to repay it in 5, 10, or 20 years based on their financial situation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounting &amp; Tax Advantages: Interest paid on bank loans is deductible from taxable income, providing borrowers with tax savings. This deduction can be advantageous for budgeting and planning monthly loan expenses. It's particularly beneficial for fixed-rate loans, although a simple model can be prepared for changes in floating-rate loans.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ownership Remains with Borrower: Bank loans allow companies to raise funds while retaining ownership. Unlike other methods of raising capital, such as issuing equity shares or involving venture capital, where the company may need to relinquish ownership shares, bank loans enable businesses to secure funds without sacrificing ownership stakes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cash Discount: Many creditors offer cash discounts, which can be availed of when funds are readily available for payment. Bank limits can support businesses in seizing cash discount opportunities. However, it's crucial for business owners to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to ensure that the benefits of cash discounts outweigh the interest costs associated with utilizing funds for payment.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Bank loans offer numerous advantages that cater to a variety of financial needs and situations. These merits make bank loans an essential tool for individuals and businesses seeking to achieve their goals and manage their finances effectively.</p>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-2%20Sources%20of%20finance%20and%20Capitalization/2.4%20Loan%20financing.html#demerits","title":"Demerits:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Additional Burden on Cost of Goods: One significant drawback of bank loans is that borrowers end up paying more than the purchase price of the product or service when they use a loan. For instance, if an individual buys a smartphone for USD 800.00 but decides to borrow USD 500.00 through a bank loan at a 10% annual interest rate, the total repayment becomes USD 550.00 (USD 500.00 principal + USD 50.00 interest). In this case, the individual paid USD 50.00 more than the product's original price. When dealing with larger loan amounts, this additional cost can become quite substantial.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security Needs and Creditworthiness: Obtaining a bank loan can be challenging unless the borrower or company has a strong credit score or valuable collateral. Banks are cautious lenders, and they extend loans primarily to borrowers who demonstrate the ability and willingness to repay. New businesses and individuals with limited credit history may find it even more difficult to secure a bank loan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partial Funding Requirement: In the case of term loans, banks often impose partial payment requirements on borrowers. This means that borrowers must contribute a portion of the total loan amount from their own funds. The percentage of partial payment can vary but may range from 10% to 40% in some cases. For example, if a company needs a USD 10,000.00 loan to purchase a new office, the bank may stipulate that the company must invest USD 1,000.00 of its own capital. If the borrower lacks sufficient funds for the partial payment, the bank may reject the loan application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strict Repayment Schedule: Banks prescribe a rigorous repayment schedule that borrowers must adhere to strictly. Failure to meet these scheduled payments can result in a reduction in the borrower's credit score and future borrowing credibility. The stringent repayment schedule can sometimes create a financial burden for borrowers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepayment Penalties and Charges: Most banks charge borrowers for repaying their loans ahead of schedule, resulting in an additional cost to the borrower. Some financial institutions impose hefty prepayment penalties and charges. Prospective borrowers are advised to thoroughly review the loan agreement to determine if it includes any prepayment penalties. If such penalties exist, borrowers should carefully assess their loan requirements and the desired loan tenure to avoid unnecessary costs.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Bank loans are a significant financial tool with the potential to facilitate growth and meet diverse financial needs.

In simpler terms, it occurs when a company's assets are overvalued compared to their actual earning potential.</p> <p>Illustration:</p> <p>For example, if a company's book value of assets is Rs. 25,00,000 (represented by a capitalization of 25,00,000, consisting of equity capital, preference capital, and debentures), but the real value of assets based on their earning capacity is only Rs. 15,00,000, there is over-capitalization in the company to the extent of Rs. 10,00,000. This means that the company's earnings are generated only from Rs. 15,00,000 worth of assets, while it has a capitalization of Rs. 25,00,000.

In the United States, this concept is commonly known as \"leverage.\"</p> <p>The gearing ratio measures the financial risk of a company and expresses the amount of a company's debt in terms of its equity. A higher gearing ratio indicates that a company has a larger amount of debt relative to its equity value. For example, a company with a gearing ratio of 2.0 would have twice as much debt as equity.</p> <p>The formula for calculating the capital gearing ratio is as follows:</p> <p>Capital Gearing Ratio = Common Stockholders' Equity / Fixed Cost Bearing Funds</p> <p>In this formula: - Common Stockholders' Equity includes share capital, share premium, general reserves, and participatory preference shares. It represents the equity portion of the company's capital structure. - Fixed Cost Bearing Funds consist of long-term bonds, term loans, and preference shares with fixed dividend payouts. These represent the debt portion of the capital structure.</p> <p>Importance of Capital Gearing Ratio:</p> <p>The gearing ratio is a crucial metric for assessing a company's financial health and risk. It helps investors and analysts understand how a company uses debt to enhance its capital. Here are some key points regarding the importance of the gearing ratio:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Financial Risk Assessment: The gearing ratio provides insights into the financial risk or solvency risk of a company. It measures the impact of debt on the capital structure and evaluates the level of financial risk associated with additional debt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Efficiency: It assesses how efficiently a company utilizes its capital structure by balancing debt and equity. Debt can offer cost advantages due to tax shields on interest payments, but it also creates committed liabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Investor Decision-Making: Investors use the gearing ratio to make informed investment decisions. A high gearing ratio may indicate higher financial risk, while a low ratio suggests a more conservative capital structure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creditworthiness: Lenders and creditors assess a company's gearing ratio to evaluate its creditworthiness. A lower gearing ratio may lead to more favorable borrowing terms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Structure Optimization: Companies can use the gearing ratio to optimize their capital structure. By adjusting the mix of debt and equity, they can lower their cost of capital and enhance shareholder value.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, the capital gearing ratio is a valuable tool for understanding how a company leverages debt in its capital structure.

It posits that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received.</p> <p>Importance:</p> <p>The importance of the time value of money is multifold:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Investment Decisions: TVM is crucial in making investment decisions. When investors consider various options, they look at the future value of their investments to determine which will yield the most returns over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Opportunity Cost: It helps in understanding the opportunity cost of money. Not investing or using money to its fullest potential today leads to a loss of potential earnings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inflation Impact: Money loses value over time due to inflation. TVM helps investors and savers plan for their future by considering the eroding impact of inflation on their savings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Loan and Mortgage Calculations: Lenders use the principle of TVM to determine loan payment schedules. Mortgages, car loans, and other types of loans calculate payments based on the time value of money.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Need:</p> <p>The need for understanding the time value of money arises in various contexts:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Financial Planning: For both personal finance and corporate finance, comprehending TVM is essential to ensure that savings and investments grow over time to meet future needs and goals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Budgeting: Businesses use TVM to decide whether to undertake projects or investments, considering the present value of future cash flows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pricing of Financial Instruments: The valuation of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments relies on forecasting future cash flows and discounting them to present value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Retirement Planning: TVM helps in calculating the amount needed to save today to reach a desired retirement fund.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Time Value of Money Using Table Value:</p> <p>Time value of money calculations often utilize present value (PV) and future value (FV) tables. These tables provide the factors required to calculate the present or future value of money at different interest rates and time periods.</p> <ul> <li>Present Value: To find the present value, you use a present value factor which discounts the future amount by a certain interest rate for a certain number of periods.</li> </ul> <p>\\( PV = FV \\times (1 / (1 + r)^n) \\)</p> <p>Where \\( PV \\) is the present value, \\( FV \\) is the future value, \\( r \\) is the interest rate per period, and \\( n \\) is the number of periods.</p> <ul> <li>Future Value: To find the future value, you use a future value factor which compounds the present amount at a certain interest rate for a certain number of periods.</li> </ul> <p>\\( FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n \\)</p> <p>In these formulas, the factor \\( (1 + r)^n \\) (for FV) or its reciprocal \\( (1 / (1 + r)^n) \\) (for PV) can be found in financial tables, which saves time and simplifies calculations.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a basic example:</p> <p>Suppose you have $1,000 today and can invest it at an annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years. Using a future value table, you find the factor for 5% (interest rate) at 3 years (time period), which might be around 1.158. You calculate the future value as follows:</p> <p>\\( FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n \\)</p> <p>\\( FV = $1,000 * 1.158 \\)</p> <p>\\( FV = $1,158 \\)</p> <p>Thus, the future value of $1,000 today at 5% interest over 3 years is $1,158.</p> <p>By understanding and utilizing the time value of money, individuals and businesses can make informed financial decisions, maximize their wealth, and ensure financial security over time.</p>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-5%20Capital%20budgeting/5.5%20capital%20budgeting%20process.html","title":"Capital Budgeting Process","text":"<p>Capital budgeting is a crucial financial management process that companies undertake to evaluate potential major investments or expenditures.

This could include operational costs, maintenance, and projected revenues or savings.</li> <li>Evaluating Costs and Benefits: This is done using various capital budgeting techniques such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Payback Period, and Profitability Index (PI). These techniques take into account the time value of money, helping to determine the value today of future cash flows.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Investment Appraisal and Selection:</p> <ul> <li>In this step, each investment's financial performance is evaluated and compared. This involves using the calculated financial indicators (NPV, IRR, etc.) to assess the potential return against the company's required rate of return or hurdle rate.</li> <li>Investments are ranked based on these indicators, and the best ones are selected for implementation.

The cycle depicts the process through which a business turns its products into cash and includes the following stages:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Cash: The cycle starts with cash on hand which will be used to purchase raw materials.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounts Payable: This represents the money a company owes to its suppliers from whom it has purchased raw materials on credit. The management of accounts payable is crucial as it affects the company's cash flow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raw Materials: Purchased raw materials are the initial stage in the production process. Managing raw materials inventory efficiently ensures that the company has enough to meet production needs without tying up too much capital in inventory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Work In Progress (WIP): Raw materials are then converted into work-in-progress goods. These are goods that are in the process of being manufactured but are not yet complete. During this phase, value is added to the raw materials through labor and overhead costs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finished Goods: Once the goods are completed, they are moved to finished goods inventory, ready to be sold to customers. It's vital to manage this inventory effectively to meet sales demand without overproducing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sales: The finished goods are sold, either for cash or on credit terms. Sales on credit terms will create accounts receivable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounts Receivable: This represents the money owed by customers to the company for goods sold on credit. Efficiently managing accounts receivable ensures that the company collects its cash as quickly as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cash: The cycle completes when the accounts receivable are collected and converted back into cash. This cash can then be used to pay off accounts payable, purchase more raw materials, or cover other business expenses.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The goal in managing the working capital cycle is to minimize the length of the cycle to improve the company's liquidity and operational efficiency. A shorter cycle means that the company can convert its working capital into cash faster, which is beneficial for meeting its short-term obligations and reducing its reliance on external financing. The working capital cycle is the time taken to complete the above cycle. It is calculated as follows:</p> <p>Working Capital Cycle = Inventory Days + Receivable Days - Payable Days</p> <p>where,</p> <ul> <li>Inventory Days = (Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365</li> <li>Receivable Days = (Average Receivables / Sales) * 365</li> <li>Payable Days = (Average Payables / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365</li> </ul>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/FM/Unit-7%20Management%20of%20working%20capital/7.4%20adequate%20working%20capital.html","title":"Adequate Working Capital","text":"<p>Adequate working capital is essential for the smooth functioning of a business.

The financial system comprises of a network of commercial banks. Non-banking companies, development banks and other financial and investment institutions offer a variety of financial products and services to suit to the varied requirements of different categories of people. Since they function in a fairly developed capital and money markets, they play a crucial role in spurring economic growth in the following ways:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Mobilising savings: The financial system mobilises the savings of the people by offering appropriate incentives and by deepening and widening the financial structure. In other words, the financial system creates varieties of forms of savings so that savings can take place according to the varying asset preferences of different classes of savers. In the absence of the financial system, all savings would remain idle in the hands of the savers and they would not have flown into productive ventures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Promoting investments: For the economic growth of any nation, investment is absolutely essential. This investment has to flow from the financial system. In fact, the level of investment determines the increase in output of goods and services and incomes in the country. The financial system collects the savings and channels them into investment which contributes positively towards economic development. </p> </li> <li> <p>Encouraging investment in financial assets: The dynamic role of the financial system in the economic development is that it encourages savings to flow into financial assets (money and monetary assets) as against physical assets (land, gold and other goods and services). The investments in physical assets are speculative and would breed inflation. On the other hand, investment in financial assets are non-inflationary in nature and would aid growth in the economy. The larger the proportion of the financial assets, the greater is the scope for economic growth in the long run.</p> </li> <li> <p>Allocating savings on the basis of national priorities: Above all, the financial system allocates the savings in a more efficient manner so that the scarce capital may be more efficiently utilised among the various alternative investments. In other words, it gives preference to certain sectors, from the social and economic point of view, on the basis of national priorities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creating credit: Large financial resources are needed for the economic development of a nation. These resources are supplied by the financial system not only in the form of liquid cash but also in the form of 'created money' or 'deposit money' by creating credit and thereby making available large resources to finance trade, production, distribution, etc. Thus, it accelerates economic growth by facilitating the transactions of trade, production and distribution on a large-scale.</p> </li> <li> <p>Providing a spectrum of financial assets: The financial system spectrum of financial assets so as to meet the varied requirements and preferences of households. Thus, it enables them to choose their asset portfolios in such a way as to achieve a preferred mix of return, liquidity and risk. Thus, it contributes to the economie development of a country.</p> </li> <li> <p>Financing trade, industry and agriculture: All the financial institutions operating in a financial system take all efforts to ensure that no worthwhile project-be it in trade or agriculture or industry-suffers due to lack of funds. Thus, they promote industrial and agricultural development which have a greater say on the economic development of a country.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encouraging entrepreneurial talents: The financial institutions encourage the managerial and entrepreneurial talents in the economy by promoting the spirit of enterprise and risk-taking capacity. They also furnish the necessary technical consultancy services to the entrepreneurs so that they may succeed in their innovative ventures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Providing financial services: Sophistication and innovations have started appearing in the arena of financial intermediations as well. The financial institutions play a very dynamic role in the economic development of a country not only as a provider of finance, but also as a departmental store of finance by offering varieties of innovative financial products and services to meet the ever-increasing demands of their clients both corporates and individuals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Developing backward areas: The integral policy of the national development plans of every country concentrates on the development of relatively less developed areas called backward areas. The financial institutions provide a package of services, infrastructure and incentives conducive to a healthy growth of industries in such backward areas and thus, they contribute for the uniform development of all regions in a country.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/FMS%20%28IFS%29/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Financial%20System/1.6%20Evolution%20of%20Indian%20financial%20system.html","title":"Evolution of Indian Financial System","text":"<p>Pre-Independence Phase (Before 1947):</p> <ol> <li>Establishment of the Bank of Hindustan in Calcutta during this period marked an early development in India's financial system.</li> </ol> <p>Evolution of Financial System (1947-1991):</p> <ol> <li> <p>Post-Independence Phase: Following India's independence in 1947, there was a gradual evolution of the financial system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nationalization of Financial Institutions: During this period, the Indian government nationalized several financial institutions to bring them under public ownership, including major banks like the Reserve Bank of India and others.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Post-1991 Phase (1991 and Beyond): 1.

This can be advantageous in times of volatility in global markets or when foreign investments are subject to regulatory changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>No Allotment to QIBs Related to Promoters: QIP regulations typically prohibit the allocation of shares to QIBs who are related to the company's promoters.

This practice enables investors to purchase more assets than they could with their available funds alone. Here's how margin trading works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Opening a Margin Trading Facility (MTF) Account: To engage in margin trading, investors need to open an MTF account with a broker. This account is distinct from a Demat (Dematerialized) account, which is used for holding and trading securities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Minimum Balance (Initial Margin): Brokers specify a minimum balance that must be maintained in the margin account, known as the initial margin. Before initiating a trade, investors are required to deposit a certain percentage of the total traded value into the account. The broker provides the remaining funds necessary for the trade. Interest is charged by the broker on the funded amount, which acts as a loan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securities Allowed: The securities that can be traded on margin are predefined by regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the stock exchange. Investors can only use margin trading for approved securities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leverage: Margin trading allows investors to leverage their position in the stock market. By putting up a portion of the total trade value and borrowing the rest from the broker, investors can control a larger position. This leverage can amplify potential gains, but it also increases the level of risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interest Charges: Brokers charge interest on the borrowed funds used for margin trading. The interest rate may vary depending on the broker and market conditions. It's essential for investors to be aware of these interest charges, as they can impact the overall profitability of margin trades.</p> </li> <li> <p>Carry Forward Positions: Investors can typically carry forward their positions for a specified number of days, denoted as T+ N, where T represents the trading day, and N is the number of days that the position can be held. The specific rules for carrying forward positions may vary among brokers.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Margin Trading Example: Let's illustrate margin trading with an example:</p> <p>Suppose an investor, X, has Rs 20,000 and wants to purchase shares worth Rs 50,000. If the authorized broker has set the margin requirement at 20%, here's how it works:</p> <ul> <li>X pays 20% of Rs 50,000, which is Rs 10,000, from their own funds.</li> <li>The broker lends X the remaining Rs 40,000 to complete the purchase.</li> <li>The broker charges interest on the Rs 40,000 borrowed, typically calculated based on the interest rate agreed upon in the margin trading agreement.</li> </ul> <p>Margin trading can amplify both gains and losses, so it's essential for investors to have a thorough understanding of the risks involved and carefully manage their positions to avoid potential margin calls, where the broker demands additional funds to cover losses.</p>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/FMS%20%28IFS%29/Unit-4%20Money%20Market/4.1%20Introduction%20%26%20Meaning%20%26%20Significance.html","title":"Money Market","text":"<p>The money market is a crucial segment of the financial market where short-term borrowing and lending of funds take place.

Banks can borrow funds from the money market to meet unexpected cash shortages or regulatory requirements, ensuring smooth operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interest Rate Benchmark: The money market serves as a benchmark for short-term interest rates. Central banks use their control over the money market to implement monetary policy, influencing interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Financing Short-Term Needs: Businesses and governments often require short-term financing to cover working capital needs, manage cash flow, or bridge temporary funding gaps.

Through its policies, it ensures that funds are available for various sectors, including industries, agriculture, and infrastructure, thereby supporting economic growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creation of Credit: RBI has the authority to issue currency notes and control the money supply in the economy. By regulating the money supply, RBI influences the availability of credit in the money market, which, in turn, affects the overall credit creation process by banks and financial institutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Channelizing Funds towards Productive Investment: One of RBI's primary objectives is to ensure that funds are channeled toward productive and priority sectors of the economy. It achieves this by setting lending norms, interest rates, and credit allocation guidelines for banks and financial institutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encouraging the Right Type of Industries: RBI uses its regulatory powers to encourage investments in sectors that are deemed crucial for economic development. By offering incentives and directing credit flow, RBI helps promote industries that contribute to sustainable growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Banks Monetize Debt: RBI regulates the issuance and trading of various money market instruments, including Treasury Bills and Commercial Paper. Banks and financial institutions participate in these markets, helping to monetize government debt and corporate debt, which, in turn, provides investment opportunities for individuals and institutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finance to Government: RBI acts as the banker to the government, facilitating government borrowing through the issuance of government securities. It manages the government's cash balances and provides funds to meet its expenditure requirements, thus supporting fiscal stability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Employment Generation: Through its policies, RBI aims to create an environment conducive to economic growth, which, in turn, leads to increased employment opportunities in various sectors. A healthy money market contributes to economic expansion and job creation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Banks Promote Entrepreneurship: RBI's regulatory framework encourages banks to provide credit to entrepreneurs and small businesses. This helps in promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, driving economic development.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, RBI's role in the Indian money market is multifaceted and extends beyond mere regulation.

When excess staff results from permanent market changes, letting employees go may be your best response. If reasons for the surplus are temporary, consider the costs of hiring and training compared to the expense of retaining staff.</p> </li> <li> <p>Outsourcing:    If you regularly use employment agencies to cover your staffing needs, discontinuing this in times of a labour surplus is obvious. In fact, if your business is subject to fluctuating staffing needs, using outsourced staff during labour deficits can smooth out your need for permanent employees.</p> </li> <li> <p>Retraining:    Some labour surpluses are across the board, affecting all departments. If this is not the case, however, then redistributing excess staff may be an option. Retraining employees who are already familiar with the culture of your enterprise offers present and future flexibility at a fraction of the expense that new hires cost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hiring Freeze:    For large organizations with many departments and an equally large workforce, implementing a hiring freeze can help prevent aggravating a labour surplus. With a freeze in place, managers downstream must explore other options to fill their labour needs without adding to the overall company payroll.</p> </li> <li> <p>Buyouts and Retirement:    Although it may not be a good short-term solution, offering early retirement or contract buyouts may produce sufficient attrition to reduce your labour surplus. There are potential financial benefits as well, since employees near retirement age may be toward the top of the wage scale. Depending on your company\u2019s accounting methods, buyouts may come out of the operational budget, improving departmental performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pay Cuts:    Though it\u2019s all but certain to have a negative effect on morale, across-the-board pay cuts may produce savings in wages that permit you to weather a labour surplus without layoffs. Wage reductions can be temporary or permanent but be sure to consider what this action may do to your company\u2019s employment brand and labour relations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modified Plans:    In this age of increased emphasis on work/life balance, you may have employees who might welcome reduced hours or work-from-home arrangements. Offering a leave of absence could help smooth out a temporary surplus. Although reduced hours may have the same net effect as a pay cut, reducing the hours may be better received by staff, who will see that their wage rate has been maintained.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seasonal Hiring Policies:    When your business experiences regular and predictable labour surpluses, plan accordingly during hiring periods, bringing aboard new hires only for the labour deficit period. You may be able to build a regular seasonal staff, as well as a pool of potential permanent workers, should the demand arise.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/HRM/Unit-3%20Recruitment%20and%20Selection/3.1%20Concept%20of%20Recruitment.html","title":"Recruitment in Human Resources","text":"<p>Recruitment is a fundamental concept in human resources management that plays a pivotal role in shaping an organization's workforce.

Here's an overview of some common errors in performance appraisals:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Halo Effect: This occurs when an appraiser generalizes one aspect of an employee's performance or behavior and extends it to all other aspects of their performance. For instance, if an employee is particularly skilled in one area, the appraiser might give them high ratings across all areas, even where improvement is needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recency Effect: In this case, the evaluator focuses too much on the employee\u2019s most recent behavior or performance, neglecting the overall performance throughout the entire appraisal period. This can result in an unbalanced assessment that does not accurately reflect the employee's overall contributions and abilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partiality: This happens when an evaluator favors certain employees over others based on personal liking or relationships rather than their actual performance. Such favoritism can lead to unfair evaluations, where some employees are rated more favorably than others for reasons unrelated to their work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stereotyping: Stereotyping in appraisals occurs when evaluators make assumptions about an employee's capabilities and performance based on their group identity (such as gender, age, race, etc.) rather than their individual merits. This can lead to biased assessments and is unfair to the employees being evaluated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leniency: A leniency error occurs when an appraiser gives undeservingly high ratings to all employees. This can be due to the evaluator's reluctance to confront poor performance or a desire to avoid conflict. It results in a lack of differentiation between high and low performers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Central Tendency: This is the tendency to rate all employees as average, avoiding the extremes of the rating scale. This error results in a failure to recognize truly exceptional performers or those in need of significant improvement, leading to a lack of meaningful feedback for employees.</p> </li> <li> <p>Personal Bias: This involves an evaluator allowing personal prejudices (such as biases about race, gender, age, religion, etc.) to influence their ratings. Personal biases can significantly distort an appraisal, leading to unfair and inaccurate assessments.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Each of these errors can have serious implications for employee morale, motivation, and development.

Diplomatic recognition is a formal acknowledgment by one state of the sovereignty and legitimacy of another. Without sovereignty, a state cannot establish embassies, sign treaties, or engage in other forms of diplomatic interaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>National Interests and Security: Sovereignty guides state behavior in international affairs. States act to safeguard their national interests, security, and independence. They make foreign policy decisions based on their perception of what is in their best interest, often pursuing policies that enhance their sovereignty or protect it from perceived threats.</p> </li> <li> <p>Challenges to Sovereignty: While sovereignty is a fundamental principle, it is not absolute and faces various challenges. Global interdependence, human rights concerns, and transnational issues such as climate change, terrorism, and pandemics have highlighted the need for collective action. These issues often require states to cede some degree of sovereignty to international organizations or engage in cooperative efforts to address common challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance Between Sovereignty and Global Challenges: Striking a balance between respecting state sovereignty and addressing global challenges is a central dilemma in contemporary international politics. The tension between the principles of non-interference in a state's internal affairs and the responsibility to protect human rights, for example, underscores this challenge. The international community grapples with questions of when and how to intervene in the internal affairs of a sovereign state to prevent humanitarian crises.</p> </li> <li> <p>Global Governance: Sovereignty also plays a crucial role in the structure of global governance. International organizations like the United Nations are founded on principles that respect the sovereignty of member states while providing mechanisms for cooperation and conflict resolution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Evolving Concept: The concept of sovereignty has evolved over time. Traditional notions of absolute sovereignty have given way to concepts like \"responsibility to protect\" (R2P), which assert that states have a responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocities, and if they fail to do so, the international community may intervene.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, sovereignty is a foundational concept in international relations that defines statehood, guides state behavior, and shapes the dynamics of global politics. While it remains a cherished principle, its application and limitations continue to evolve as the world grapples with complex global challenges that require a delicate balance between respecting state sovereignty and addressing pressing issues of international concern.</p>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/IR/Unit%20-1%20Introduction%20to%20International%20Relations/1.1.a%20Sovereignty.html#anarchy","title":"Anarchy","text":"<p>The concept of anarchy is indeed a foundational idea in the field of International Relations (IR), especially within the framework of realism. Anarchy, in this context, has several key implications:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Absence of Central Authority: Anarchy in IR means that there is no overarching world government or central authority that has the power to enforce laws and maintain order among sovereign states. Unlike within a domestic political system where a government has authority over its citizens, states in the international system exist in a decentralized and self-help environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-Help and Survival: Because of anarchy, states are compelled to rely on their own capabilities and resources to ensure their survival and protect their interests. This self-help mentality is a fundamental aspect of realist thinking. States cannot assume that other states will necessarily act in their favor, so they must be prepared to defend themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Competitive Environment: Anarchy creates a competitive environment in which states often vie for power, influence, and resources. This competition can lead to conflicts, both in terms of armed conflicts and diplomatic rivalries. Realists argue that in such a system, it is natural for states to act in their own self-interest, prioritizing their own security and well-being.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alliances and Diplomacy: To navigate the challenges of an anarchic system, states often form alliances and engage in diplomacy. Alliances can provide a measure of security by increasing a state's power and deterring potential aggressors. Diplomacy is a means by which states can negotiate agreements and manage conflicts without resorting to military force.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexibility and Autonomy: Anarchy, while presenting challenges, also allows for flexibility and adaptability in international relations. States have the autonomy to make their own decisions and forge alliances as they see fit, without being subject to a higher authority. This flexibility can lead to shifting power dynamics and diverse international interactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Realist Perspective: Anarchy is particularly emphasized in realist theories of IR, which contend that states are primarily motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of power. Realists argue that the absence of a central authority makes it imperative for states to focus on their own security and interests, often leading to a pessimistic view of international relations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Critical Role in IR Theory: Anarchy is a critical concept in IR theory, serving as the foundation upon which different schools of thought, such as realism, liberalism, and constructivism, build their analyses of international politics. While realists highlight the competitive and conflict-prone nature of anarchy, other theories explore how states can cooperate and build institutions to manage this anarchic system more effectively.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, anarchy is a central concept in International Relations theory, especially within the realist perspective. It underscores the absence of a central global authority and the resulting self-help nature of states in the international system, which has profound implications for state behavior, cooperation, conflict, and the dynamics of global politics.</p>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/IR/Unit%20-1%20Introduction%20to%20International%20Relations/1.2%20Concepts%20and%20Theories%20of%20IR.html","title":"Theories of International Relations","text":""},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/IR/Unit%20-1%20Introduction%20to%20International%20Relations/1.2%20Concepts%20and%20Theories%20of%20IR.html#1-realism","title":"1.

Given the absence of a global police force, states must rely on their own resources and capabilities to protect themselves. This often leads to the pursuit of military strength and alliances to deter potential threats.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distributions of power: Realism places great importance on the distribution of power among states.

Here's a more detailed explanation of each type of new diplomacy:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Track II Diplomacy: This form of diplomacy operates outside the official governmental channels. It typically involves individuals or groups who are not officially part of the government but have significant influence or expertise, such as academics, think tanks, private sector leaders, and NGOs. Their role is often to create an informal environment where complex issues can be discussed more openly and creatively than in formal settings. Track II diplomacy fosters mutual understanding and can help to build the groundwork for official negotiations. The Oslo Accords are a prime example, where unofficial discussions laid the foundation for formal peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parliamentary Diplomacy: This involves members of legislative bodies from different countries engaging in dialogue and exchange. Unlike traditional diplomacy, which is executed by executive branches (like the State Department in the U.S.), parliamentary diplomacy allows legislators to use their unique position to influence foreign policy, promote democratic values, and strengthen international cooperation. Such diplomacy often occurs in international assemblies or organizations, like the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, where legislators discuss issues like security, democracy, and international law.</p> </li> <li> <p>Science Diplomacy: This approach uses scientific collaboration to address global challenges and build bridges between nations. Science diplomacy can take various forms, including collaborative research projects, science advice in diplomatic contexts, and scientific cooperation as a tool for improving international relations. A prominent example is the International Space Station (ISS), which represents a significant joint effort among multiple countries for scientific research in space. The ISS demonstrates how science can transcend geopolitical boundaries, fostering cooperation even among nations that may have strained political relationships.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These forms of diplomacy acknowledge the interconnectedness of today's world, where issues and challenges are no longer confined within national borders. They represent a shift from traditional state-centric diplomacy to more inclusive approaches that involve a variety of actors, from NGOs and scientists to lawmakers and private sector experts. This diversification in diplomatic practices is crucial for addressing the multifaceted problems of the 21st century and promoting a more collaborative and peaceful international order.</p>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/IR/Unit%20-3%20International%20Peace%20and%20Security/3.5%20new%20diplomacy.html#traditional-diplomacy-vs-new-diplomacy","title":"Traditional Diplomacy vs. New Diplomacy","text":"<p>The following table summarizes the differences between traditional diplomacy and new diplomacy in terms of approach, methods and tools, focus and priorities, inclusivity, and response to technological advances.</p> Point of Difference Traditional Diplomacy New Diplomacy Approach - Formal and state-centric - Evolved to include non-traditional, dynamic methods - Predominantly government officials and representatives - Involves various stakeholders including civil society, NGOs, businesses, and academia Methods and Tools - In-person meetings, formal negotiations, embassies - Digital tools, social media, public engagement - Emphasizes confidentiality and state-to-state interactions - Utilizes video conferencing and digital communication tools Focus and Priorities - State-to-state relations, security issues, national interests driven by geopolitics - Broader issues like climate change, human rights, economic cooperation, and cultural exchange Inclusivity - Exclusive, involving government officials, limited participation and perspectives - Inclusive, involving various stakeholders, encourages diverse perspectives and expertise Response to Technological Advances - Adapts to technological changes but remains reliant on established diplomatic protocols - Embraces latest technologies for efficiency and wider engagement"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/IR/Unit%20-3%20International%20Peace%20and%20Security/3.5%20new%20diplomacy.html#new-diplomacy-vs-old-diplomacy","title":"New Diplomacy vs. Old Diplomacy","text":"Aspect New Diplomacy Old Diplomacy Geographical Focus Globally oriented, acknowledging the interconnectedness and interdependence of nations across all continents.

Centered around bilateral engagements, with direct negotiations and agreements between two sovereign states. Formality Adopts a less formal approach, facilitating more dynamic and flexible interactions that include a broader range of stakeholders. Characterized by strict formalities and protocols, reflecting a more rigid and hierarchical approach to diplomacy. Transparency Promotes openness and transparency, with diplomatic processes and decisions often subject to public scrutiny and media coverage. Marked by a high degree of secrecy, with diplomatic discussions and agreements often hidden from public view. Democratic vs. Aristocratic Nature Reflects democratic principles, with a greater emphasis on public opinion, inclusivity, and accountability in diplomatic practices. Dominated by aristocratic or elite circles, often excluding public participation and oversight in diplomatic dealings. Role of Propaganda Heavily relies on propaganda and media tools to shape public opinion and exert soft power both domestically and internationally.

Amid escalating tensions between the United States and China, India has been able to maintain a balanced approach, engaging with both powers within the BRICS framework. This diversification is crucial in a rapidly changing global political landscape.</p> </li> <li> <p>Economic Cooperation: As major economic players, BRICS countries foster trade and investment opportunities. India benefits from these economic ties, including trade agreements and initiatives like the New Development Bank (NDB). This cooperation allows India to pursue economic growth without heavy reliance on any one country, balancing its economic engagements with major powers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Geopolitical Consultation: BRICS serves as a forum for dialogue on global issues, enabling India to voice its concerns and influence collective responses. India has leveraged BRICS summits to address issues like terrorism, climate change, and global governance, showing its capability to engage in a multilateral setting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strategic Autonomy: Participation in BRICS allows India to assert its strategic autonomy, avoiding over-reliance on any single power. This is particularly important for India, given its size and global significance. It provides a counterbalance to its growing defense and strategic ties with the United States.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security and Defense Cooperation: BRICS enables member states to engage in security and defense dialogues. For India, this means maintaining a balanced approach in its relationships with both Russia and China. Joint military exercises conducted under the BRICS umbrella allow for military collaboration while preserving strategic independence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Soft Power and Cultural Diplomacy: BRICS also presents an opportunity for India to promote its soft power and cultural heritage. Through cultural and educational exchanges and hosting BRICS summits, India can enhance its global profile and influence, contributing positively to its international image.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crisis Management and Conflict Resolution: As a platform for discussing global crises and conflicts, BRICS is crucial for India, situated in a region with several conflict-prone areas.

This type of behavior is commonly observed when consumers are purchasing expensive, risky, infrequently purchased, and highly self-expressive products, such as a house, a car, or a computer. The decision-making process is extensive and involves thorough research, evaluation of alternatives, and consideration of multiple factors, such as price, quality, features, and brand reputation. Consumers engage in information gathering, consult expert opinions, and rely on personal experiences to make informed decisions.</p> <p>For example, suppose a consumer wants to buy a new laptop. He would likely spend time researching different brands, comparing specifications/features, reading customer reviews, and seeking recommendations from friends or technology experts before finalizing their purchase.</p> <p>Simply put, in complex buying behaviour, the consumer will go through different learning phases. Firstly, he will learn and develop a belief regarding the product that he wants to purchase. The belief of the consumer creates his attitude based on which he will make the final purchase decision. Therefore, the marketers of the high involvement products must ensure that they understand the information-gathering and evaluation behaviour of these customers and help them learn about the attributes of the product along with their relative importance. They can also take the help of advertisements so the customers can get answers to basic questions. </p> <ul> <li>Dissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior:</li> </ul> <p>Dissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior occurs when consumers face a high level of involvement in the purchase decision but encounter little difference among brands. This type of behavior is commonly observed when consumers are purchasing expensive, infrequent, or risky products; such as furniture, curtain material, or sofa covers/upholstery. These products face high involvement of the consumer as they are expensive and self-expressive. Also, as the perceived brand difference is not large in this case, the consumers would purchase easily and readily available products.</p> <p>For example, suppose a consumer wants to buy a portable tent for camping. For this, he will have to make a quick decision from the limited options available to him. He will make the purchase decision without doing enough research and inquiring about information from different sources about it.</p> <p>Once the purchase is made, the consumers might experience post-purchase dissonance or after-sale discomfort. It happens when the consumer notices some disadvantages of the purchased brand or hears some good things about the other brand. For such dissonance, it is essential for the marketer to provide the consumers with after-sale communications and help them feel good about their brand choices.</p> <ul> <li>Habitual Buying Behavior:</li> </ul> <p>Habitual Buying Behavior occurs when consumers face a low level of involvement in the purchase decision along with little significant brand differences. This type of behavior is commonly observed when consumers are purchasing products like salt, etc. Low involvement of consumers means that they simply reach the store and go for a brand to buy a product. If the consumer is buying a product from the same brand, it does not mean that they are loyal to the brand. It just means that the consumer is buying the product out of habit.</p> <p>For example, buying a specific brand of toothpaste, snack items, or toiletries from a particular store without much thought or consideration falls under habitual buying behavior. Consumers may choose these products based on familiarity, past positive experiences, or simply because it is part of their routine.</p> <p>The consumer behavior, in this case, does not pass through the usual belief attitude behavior sequence. Before purchasing a product, these consumers do not extensively search for information regarding the brand, evaluate the characteristics of the brand, and make weighty decisions on which brand to purchase. Instead, they just passively receive the information while watching television or reading newspapers or magazines. Also, Ad repetitions instead of creating brand conviction, create brand familiarity in the minds of consumers. Because of this, consumers do not form strong attitudes towards a brand; they just select the brand because they are familiar with it. Therefore, the marketers take help of repetitive marketing campaigns, so that consumers can remember their brand.</p> <ul> <li>Variety-Seeking Buying Behavior:</li> </ul> <p>Variety-Seeking Buying Behavior occurs when consumers exhibit a desire for new experiences, change, and novelty in their purchases. It means that when consumers face a low level of involvement but significant perceived brand differences, they undertake variety-seeking buying behavior. In such cases, the consumers switch brands more often.</p> <p>For example, a consumer chooses a namkeen brand without doing much evaluation, and then after consuming the product, evaluates it. But the consumer might pick another brand when making a purchase the next time. The reason behind this can be his urge to try something new or just out of boredom.</p> <p>Consumers engaging in variety-seeking behavior may not have strong brand loyalty and actively seek alternatives, even if they are satisfied with their current choices. They enjoy exploring different options, experimenting with new products, and deviating from their routine purchases. This behavior is more prevalent in product categories where there are numerous options and alternatives available. Besides, the marketing strategy of the products, in this case, may differ for the minor brands and the market leader. Market leaders try to encourage the habitual buying behavior of consumers by dominating shelf space, keeping the shelves fully stocked with goods, and running advertisements frequently as a reminder. However, the challenger firms encourage the variety-seeking behavior of consumers by offering them coupons, free samples, and goods at lower prices and encouraging them through advertisements to buy something new.</p>"},{"location":"3rd_sem/docs/MM/Unit-2%20Connecting%20with%20Customers/2.4%20The%20Buyer%20Decision%20Process.html","title":"Buying Decision Process","text":"<p>The Buying Decision Process is a fundamental concept in understanding consumer behavior, as it provides insights into how individuals make purchasing decisions.

For instance, babysitting involves a service provider offering care and supervision.</li> <li>A Major Service through Tangible Goods: Tangible goods play a significant role in delivering a service. Hotels provide accommodations (service) facilitated by tangible assets like rooms and furnishings.</li> <li>A Major Goods with Service: Some products include an associated service component, often as after-sales support or maintenance contracts. Copiers with maintenance agreements are an example.</li> <li>Pure Tangible Goods: Physical products with no inherent service component, such as books, soap, and toothpaste. However, it's increasingly uncommon to find pure tangible goods as businesses enhance customer experiences with associated services.</li> </ul> <p>Services are vital contributors to modern economies, driving value creation, customer satisfaction, and business prosperity.

The agent could give in to opportunistic behaviour and self-interest, failing to live up to the principal's expectations. The division of ownership and control is the central tenet of agency theory.

These challenges primarily stem from its voluntary nature, lack of uniform procedures across industries, and the complexities involved in its implementation and maintenance. Understanding these objections is crucial for addressing them effectively and leveraging cost accounting as a powerful tool for financial management and decision-making.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Expensive to Implement and Maintain: Establishing and operating a cost accounting system requires significant resources. The detailed analysis, allocation, absorption, and apportionment of overheads entail considerable clerical work, making the system costly. It is argued that unless the benefits derived from cost accounting exceed these costs, its implementation is not justified.</p> </li> <li> <p>Discrepancies with Financial Records: Often, the results presented by cost accounting differ from those of financial accounting. This discrepancy necessitates the preparation of reconciliation statements to ensure accuracy, thereby increasing the workload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lack of Applicability Across Industries: The absence of standardized formats and systems in cost accounting makes it challenging to apply uniformly across all industries. Each industry may need to customize the system based on its specific characteristics or the nature of its products or services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perceived as Unnecessary: Some argue that maintaining cost records duplicates work, as it involves preparing both financial and cost accounts. Moreover, critics claim that cost systems do not inherently control costs or enhance efficiency; these objectives can be achieved through effective management without a formal costing system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complexity: The process of identifying, categorizing, and allocating various expenses in cost accounting is viewed as complex and burdensome.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accuracy Concerns: The use of notional costs, such as standard or estimated costs, can compromise the accuracy of cost accounting results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dependence on Secondary Data: Cost accounting often relies on data from financial statements. Thus, any limitations or errors in financial information can adversely affect cost accounting outcomes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lack of Uniform Procedures: The absence of standardized procedures in cost accounting leads to inconsistencies in its application and interpretation across different industries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Formalities and Compliance: The system requires adherence to numerous formalities, making it cumbersome and time-consuming for organizations to follow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Difficulty in Predicting Future Situations: Cost accounting systems may struggle to accurately forecast future financial scenarios, limiting their utility in strategic planning.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/CMA/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Cost%20and%20Management%20Accounting/1.c%20Limitations.html#addressing-the-concerns","title":"Addressing the Concerns","text":"<p>While these objections and limitations are significant, they are not insurmountable.

Only variable costs are considered for product costing and inventory valuation. 2 Fixed costs are charged to the cost of production. Each product bears a reasonable share of fixed cost and thus the profitability of a product is influenced by the apportionment of fixed costs. Fixed costs are regarded as period costs. The profitability of different products is judged by their P/V ratio. 3 Cost data are presented in a conventional pattern. Net profit of each product is determined after subtracting fixed cost along with their variable cost. Cost data are presented to highlight the total contribution of each product. 4 The difference in the magnitude of opening stock and closing stock affects the unit cost of production due to the impact of related fixed cost. The difference in the magnitude of opening stock and closing stock does not affect the unit cost of production. 5 In case of absorption costing the cost per unit reduces, as the production increases as it is fixed cost which reduces, whereas, the variable cost remains the same per unit. In case of marginal costing the cost per unit remains the same, irrespective of the production as it is valued at variable cost."},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/CMA/Unit-3%20Marginal%20Costing/3.c%20Difference%20between%20Marginal%20and%20Absorption%20Costing.html#detailed-explanation","title":"Detailed Explanation","text":""},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/CMA/Unit-3%20Marginal%20Costing/3.c%20Difference%20between%20Marginal%20and%20Absorption%20Costing.html#absorption-costing","title":"Absorption Costing","text":"<p>Absorption costing is a comprehensive approach to product costing that includes both variable and fixed costs.

Parameter Analysis:</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on identifying and analyzing key variables in a situation to create new ideas.</li> <li>Involves detailed analysis of variables to understand their importance and influence on solutions.</li> </ul> Venture Capital <p>Venture capital (VC) is a type of private equity and financial support that professional investors, known as venture capitalists, provide to startups and small businesses believed to have long-term growth potential. Beyond merely providing funds, venture capitalists become partners in the business, often contributing their expertise and network to guide the company's growth.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Nature of Investment: Venture capitalists invest in companies in exchange for equity, meaning they own a part of the company. They typically seek significant returns on their investments, usually aiming for a return of 20% to 40% over a period of three to five years.</p> </li> <li> <p>Role in the Company: Venture capitalists are not just investors; they also serve as advisors and partners. Their involvement can range from strategic planning to providing contacts and operational advice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Capital Base and Return: Venture capital provides startups with a solid foundation of capital that supports their initial operations and future growth plans. The infusion of this capital is crucial for companies that may not have access to traditional loans due to lack of collateral or an established financial history.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stages of Financing: Venture capital financing typically occurs in several stages, each tailored to the company\u2019s developmental stage:</p> </li> <li>Seed Money Stage: Initial funding to prove a concept or develop a product. This is the most risky stage as the business model has yet to be proven.</li> <li>Start-up Stage: Funds provided to companies less than one year old to support activities like marketing and product development.</li> <li>First-round Financing: After utilizing start-up funds, this stage helps companies begin sales and manufacturing.</li> <li>Second-round Financing: This stage provides working capital for companies that are marketing their products but have not yet become profitable.</li> <li>Third-round (Mezzanine) Financing: For companies that have reached break-even but need funds for expansion.</li> <li> <p>Fourth-round (Bridge) Financing: For companies planning to go public within six months, helping them transition to public ownership.</p> </li> <li> <p>Organizations and Ecosystem: In India, organizations like the Indian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (IVCA) promote the venture capital industry, encouraging investments in high-growth potential startups. Prominent VC firms in India include Sequoia Capital India, Ventureast, and Nexus India Capital, among others.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Venture capital plays a crucial role in the ecosystem of startups, providing not only financial resources but also strategic guidance to help young companies scale and succeed. This form of financing is vital for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in emerging markets where traditional financing options are limited.</p> Angel Investor <p>Angel investing involves high-net-worth individuals, known as angel investors, providing capital to start-up companies during their early stages. These investors are often seasoned entrepreneurs or professionals who have a history of success in their fields, and they invest their own personal funds into new ventures.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Profile of Angel Investors: Angel investors are typically individuals who have accumulated wealth through their own business ventures or professional careers. They often have experience in founding, running, or mentoring start-ups, which enables them to provide valuable guidance and expertise to new entrepreneurs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Investment Approach: Unlike venture capitalists, who manage pooled money from many investors in a fund, angel investors use their own money to invest in companies. They usually get involved during the initial phases of a business, providing the necessary capital to move from concept to early operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expectations and Returns: Angel investors generally accept a lower return on investment compared to venture capital firms, recognizing the higher risk associated with investing in nascent companies. They typically seek equity in the companies they invest in, which could potentially yield significant returns if the companies grow successfully.</p> </li> <li> <p>Role Beyond Capital: Beyond financial support, angel investors actively participate in mentoring and advising the start-ups they invest in. Their involvement can be crucial in setting strategic direction, networking, and navigating early-stage challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Target Investment Opportunities: Angel investors often focus on start-ups that are too small to attract the attention of larger VC firms, or those considered too risky for traditional bank loans. These start-ups might not have the scale yet to promise the substantial returns required by larger investment firms but have the potential for growth and profitability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Angel Networks: To facilitate investments, angel investors sometimes form networks. These networks bring together like-minded individuals interested in funding and mentoring start-ups. Well-known networks in India include the Indian Angel Network, Mumbai Angels, Chennai Funds, and the TiE Entrepreneurship Acceleration Programme. These networks not only pool financial resources but also offer a collective pool of expertise and contacts that can significantly benefit start-ups.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Angel networks typically provide not just capital but also mentorship, helping to guide start-ups through their formative stages and beyond, enhancing their chances for success and growth. They play a crucial role in the start-up ecosystem by filling the gap left by more traditional forms of financial support, which might be inaccessible to very young or high-risk ventures.</p> Project Life Cycle"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/ED/t-Imp.html#notable-indian-social-entrepreneurs","title":"Notable Indian Social Entrepreneurs","text":""},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/ED/t-Imp.html#anshu-gupta-goonj","title":"Anshu Gupta - Goonj","text":"<p>Background and Contribution: Anshu Gupta founded Goonj, a non-governmental organization based in India, with a unique focus on clothing as a basic but often overlooked need. Recognizing that clothing is not just a need but a matter of dignity, Goonj addresses this by turning urban excess into a tool for rural development across 23 states in India. </p> <p>How It Works: The innovative model of Goonj revolves around collecting unused or excess clothing from urban areas, which is then processed and repackaged to be used as a resource for the rural poor. This not only helps in clothing the needy but also reduces waste. Beyond clothing, Goonj has expanded its activities to include other essential items such as utensils, furniture, and school materials.</p> <p>Significance: The significance of Anshu Gupta\u2019s work lies in his approach to treat cloth not as charity but as a currency for development. People in rural areas receive clothes in exchange for community work, such as building bridges, digging wells, or cleaning ponds. This has led to a significant improvement in rural infrastructure, besides addressing the clothing crisis. Anshu Gupta's work has earned him the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2015, often considered Asia's Nobel Prize, recognizing his approach to enhancing the dignity and self-esteem of the poor.</p>"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/ED/t-Imp.html#jeroo-billimoria-childline-india","title":"Jeroo Billimoria - Childline India","text":"<p>Background and Contribution: Jeroo Billimoria is a prominent social entrepreneur who has founded several NGOs aimed at protecting children's rights.

Below is a comparison of their characteristics:</p> Basis for Comparison PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) CPM (Critical Path Method) Meaning PERT is a project management technique used to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a project, especially those with uncertain activity duration estimates. CPM is a statistical technique used in project management to identify the critical path, which is the longest sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the entire project to be completed on schedule. What is it? A technique for planning, scheduling, and controlling projects by analyzing the time required to complete each activity. A method for scheduling project activities, determining the critical path, and managing the time-cost trade-off. Orientation PERT is event-oriented, focusing on the events that represent the start and completion of activities. CPM is activity-oriented, concentrating on the sequence and interdependencies of project activities. Evolution PERT was developed in the 1950s by the U.S. Navy and the management consultancy firm Booz Allen Hamilton to support the Polaris submarine missile program. CPM was developed in the late 1950s by DuPont Corporation and Remington Rand for scheduling plant maintenance projects. Model PERT uses a probabilistic model, assuming that activity durations are uncertain and follow a statistical distribution. CPM uses a deterministic model, assuming that activity durations are known and fixed. Focus PERT focuses primarily on managing project time, ensuring timely completion of activities. CPM focuses on both time and cost, allowing for trade-offs between project duration and associated costs. Estimates PERT requires three-time estimates (optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic) for each activity to account for uncertainty. CPM uses a single time estimate for each activity, assuming a deterministic duration. Appropriate for PERT is suitable for projects with a high degree of uncertainty and a need for high precision time estimates. CPM is appropriate for projects with well-defined and predictable activities, where a reasonable time estimate is sufficient. Management of PERT is designed to manage unpredictable activities, where activity durations are not known with certainty. CPM is used to manage predictable activities, where activity durations can be estimated with a higher degree of confidence. Nature of jobs PERT is often used for non-repetitive projects, such as research and development initiatives. CPM is commonly employed for repetitive projects, such as construction, manufacturing, or maintenance operations. Critical and Non-critical activities In PERT, there is no explicit differentiation between critical and non-critical activities. In CPM, activities are classified as critical or non-critical, with critical activities lying on the critical path and requiring close monitoring.

Despite progress and claims of equality, they confront obstacles that hinder their ability to set up and run businesses successfully. Below is an overview of the most common challenges they face:</p> <p></p> <p>1. Gender Barriers- Indian society, though evolved, still harbors significant gender barriers. Gender inequality and pay gaps are rampant, and women often need permission from male family members to pursue careers or entrepreneurship. This environment hampers their ability to achieve and be recognized for their potential.</p> <p>2. Economic Challenges- The financial landscape in India displays a glaring gender gap. Female entrepreneurs face difficulties securing investments as a small percentage of businesses receiving funding are women-led. Prejudices from investors, coupled with the lack of property ownership or authority among women to use assets as collateral, compound these economic challenges. Small, unsecured business loans, like those from Hero FinCorp, are sometimes the only option for female entrepreneurs seeking funding without collateral.</p> <p>3. Legal and Regulatory Hurdles- Women business owners often struggle with legal issues related to marriage, divorce, property, inheritance, and obtaining business permissions. The legal space lacks sufficient representation for women, and the procedures and associated costs pose additional obstacles.</p> <p>4. Work-Life Integration- The expectation for women to manage household duties alongside their professional responsibilities creates a significant challenge for female entrepreneurs. Successful business ownership requires effective work-life integration, a feat complicated by societal norms and family commitments.</p> <p>5. Networking and Mentorship- Women entrepreneurs often find themselves isolated from both informal and formal business networks. Predominantly male professional networks and unsafe conditions for women traveling alone for business purposes further restrict their opportunities for mentorship, collaboration, and growth.</p> <p>6. Access to Resources and Technology- The journey of entrepreneurship demands continuous learning, training, and up-skilling. Female entrepreneurs frequently lack the funds necessary to create a productive business environment, purchase machinery, or invest in technology. Specialized business loans for women can provide critical support but may not be accessible to all.</p> <p>7. Overcoming Mental Barriers- The ingrained roles within India's patriarchal society place additional mental barriers on women. The expectations to prioritize domestic responsibilities over professional ambitions can deter women from pursuing entrepreneurship.</p> <p>8. Government Initiatives and Support- Recognizing the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs, the Indian government has introduced several programs aimed at supporting them. Initiatives like the Mudra Loan, Stand-Up India Scheme, Mahila Coir Yojana, CGTMSE, Udyam Shakti Portal, and TREAD are designed to facilitate female entrepreneurship and help overcome these hurdles.</p> <p>In conclusion, while there are significant challenges facing women entrepreneurs in India, there are also growing supports and resources aimed at facilitating their success. Overcoming these obstacles requires a concerted effort from both the public and private sectors to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for female entrepreneurs.</p>"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/ED/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Entrepreneurship/1.i%20Entrepreneurial%20Competencies.html","title":"Entrepreneurial Competencies","text":"<p>    Your browser does not support the audio element. </p> <p>Entrepreneurial competencies are the key characteristics, skills, and behaviors that enhance an entrepreneur's ability to successfully start and grow a venture.

Below is a comparison of their characteristics:</p> BASIS FOR COMPARISON PERT CPM Meaning PERT is a project management technique used to manage uncertain activities of a project. CPM is a statistical technique of project management that manages well-defined activities of a project. What is it? A technique of planning and control of time. A method to control cost and time. Orientation Event-oriented Activity-oriented Evolution Evolved as Research &amp; Development project Evolved as Construction project Model Probabilistic Model Deterministic Model Focuses on Time Time-cost trade-off Estimates Three-time estimates One time estimate Appropriate for High precision time estimate Reasonable time estimate Management of Unpredictable Activities Predictable activities Nature of jobs Non-repetitive nature Repetitive nature Critical and Non-critical activities No differentiation Differentiated Suitable for Research and Development Project Non-research projects like civil construction, ship building, etc. <p>Understanding the differences between PERT and CPM is crucial for project managers in selecting the appropriate technique for managing their projects. PERT is more suited for research and development projects where time is a major variable, while CPM is preferred for projects where both time and cost are equally important.</p> <p>When employing these techniques, it\u2019s important to have detailed project information and clear objectives. Gantt charts are best when a project is relatively simple or when communicating high-level timelines to stakeholders. In contrast, network techniques are more suitable for complex projects with many interdependent tasks that require detailed time analysis. By choosing the appropriate scheduling technique, project managers can significantly enhance their ability to deliver projects on time and within budget.</p>"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/ED/Unit-5%20New%20Venture%20Creation%20and%20Promotion/5.f%20Project%20Management%20Software.html","title":"Project Management Software","text":"<p>    Your browser does not support the audio element. </p> <p>Project Management Software encompasses a range of tools that provide project leaders with the ability to plan, implement, monitor, and complete projects within the constraints of time, budget, and resources.

This not only helps in clothing the needy but also reduces waste. Beyond clothing, Goonj has expanded its activities to include other essential items such as utensils, furniture, and school materials.</p> <p>Significance: The significance of Anshu Gupta\u2019s work lies in his approach to treat cloth not as charity but as a currency for development. People in rural areas receive clothes in exchange for community work, such as building bridges, digging wells, or cleaning ponds. This has led to a significant improvement in rural infrastructure, besides addressing the clothing crisis.

Companies with this outlook assume that strategies and products successful in their domestic market will automatically translate to success in international markets, without any modifications. This perspective often leads to a preference for appointing executives from the home country, driven by the belief that they are best suited to understand and implement the company's vision worldwide.</p> <p>Detailed Examples</p> <ul> <li> <p>Nissan's Misstep in the US Market: Nissan faced challenges when exporting automobiles designed for Japan's milder winters to the USA, where winter conditions are far more severe. The company's oversight was assuming that American consumers would adopt the Japanese practice of covering their cars with blankets to aid in starting during cold weather. This assumption led to difficulties in the American market, highlighting the pitfalls of an ethnocentric approach.</p> </li> <li> <p>Walt Disney's Cultural Clash in France: Walt Disney's expansion into France with Disneyland Paris was initially met with resistance due to its ethnocentric approach. The company replicated its US theme park model, including a ban on alcohol, which clashed with French cultural norms where wine is commonly consumed with meals. Additionally, the park was criticized as an emblem of American cultural imperialism, further exacerbated by political tensions between the US and France. These challenges underscored the limitations of applying a one-size-fits-all strategy across diverse cultural landscapes.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/GB/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Global%20Business/1.q%20EPRG%20Approaches%20to%20International%20Business.html#polycentric-orientation","title":"Polycentric Orientation","text":"<p>Companies adopting a Polycentric Orientation recognize and respect the diversity of international markets. This approach is grounded in the belief that each country has its unique cultural, economic, and market conditions that require customized strategies. Subsidiaries in different countries are granted autonomy to develop their marketing and operational plans, often led by local executives who are presumed to have a better understanding of the local market dynamics.</p> <p>Detailed Examples</p> <ul> <li> <p>McDonald\u2019s Global Menu Strategy: McDonald's epitomizes the polycentric approach by tailoring its menu to align with local tastes and cultural preferences. In India, where a significant portion of the population is vegetarian, McDonald's introduced vegetarian menu items, a stark contrast to its beef-centric offerings in the United States. Similarly, in European countries like France, McDonald's caters to local palate preferences by including wine as a beverage option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Google's Doodle Diversity: Google demonstrates its polycentric orientation through its daily Google Doodle variations, which celebrate local heroes, events, and cultural festivities unique to each country. This approach not only honors local diversity but also enhances Google's connection with users worldwide by acknowledging and celebrating their cultural heritage.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/GB/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Global%20Business/1.q%20EPRG%20Approaches%20to%20International%20Business.html#regiocentric-orientation","title":"Regiocentric Orientation","text":"<p>The Regiocentric Orientation posits that countries within the same geographic region share certain similarities that can be leveraged to develop regional strategies. This approach simplifies the complexity of global operations by allowing companies to tailor their strategies to regional blocs, assuming that these blocs exhibit homogenous characteristics.</p> <p>Detailed Examples</p> <ul> <li> <p>Coca-Cola's Regional Messaging: Coca-Cola adopts a regiocentric approach by crafting advertising and promotional messages that resonate with regional audiences, such as those in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), thereby acknowledging and leveraging regional similarities in consumer behavior and preferences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Goodyear's Regional Market Segmentation: Goodyear International categorizes its markets into regional segments like Asia-Pacific and Europe, tailoring its product offerings and marketing strategies to the distinct characteristics of these regions. This approach allows Goodyear to efficiently manage its operations across diverse markets by recognizing regional commonalities.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/GB/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Global%20Business/1.q%20EPRG%20Approaches%20to%20International%20Business.html#geocentric-orientation","title":"Geocentric Orientation","text":"<p>The Geocentric Orientation embodies a truly global perspective, wherein companies view the entire world as a single, potential market. This orientation discards the notion of national borders as barriers and seeks to develop global strategies that leverage the best practices and ideas from around the world. Companies with a geocentric outlook strive to balance global efficiencies with local responsiveness, aiming to achieve a universal appeal while respecting local nuances.</p> <p>Detailed Examples</p> <ul> <li> <p>KFC's Catering to Indian Tastes: KFC adapts its offerings to cater to the vegetarian preferences prevalent in India by introducing items like the 'vegetarian thali' and Chana snacker. This strategy demonstrates KFC's commitment to combining global brand strength with local market adaptation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Viacom's MTV Localization: Viacom's MTV channels, including MTV India, MTV China, and MTV Korea</p> </li> </ul> <p>, showcase a geocentric orientation by branding and programming according to local cultural norms and preferences.

Here are the key elements that typically make up export credit terms:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Interest Rate</p> <ul> <li>Description: The interest rate on export credit can be either fixed or variable. It represents the cost of borrowing and is applied to the principal amount extended to the exporter.</li> <li>Factors Influencing Rate: The rate may vary based on market conditions, the creditworthiness of the exporter, and the length of the credit period.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tenor</p> <ul> <li>Description: The tenor of export credit refers to the duration over which the credit must be repaid. It is a crucial aspect that dictates the timeline for financial planning for repayment.</li> <li>Variability: The duration can differ based on the nature of the transaction and the agreements between the exporter and the financing institution.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Repayment Schedule</p> <ul> <li>Description: This schedule outlines the specific timings and amounts for repayments that the exporter must adhere to during the credit period.</li> <li>Structure: Repayment can be uniform across the period, or it may vary (e.g., balloon payments or varied installment amounts), depending on the exporter's cash flow and financial strategy.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Security and Collateral</p> <ul> <li>Description: Exporters are often required to provide some form of security or collateral against the credit they receive. This acts as a safety net for financing institutions against potential defaults.</li> <li>Types of Security: Collateral can include physical assets, guarantees from third parties, or other valuable financial instruments.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Grace Period</p> <ul> <li>Description: A grace period may be granted, during which the exporter is not required to make principal repayments, or might only need to cover the interest payments.</li> <li>Purpose: This period can help exporters manage their cash flows better, especially if revenue generation from the exported goods is expected to be delayed.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Currency</p> <ul> <li>Description: The currency in which the credit is denominated is specified in the export credit terms. This could be either the local currency of the exporter or a foreign currency.</li> <li>Selection Factors: The choice of currency is influenced by the preferences of the involved parties and the primary currency used in international trade transactions.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Fees and Charges</p> <ul> <li>Description: Additional fees and charges may apply to the export credit, which are meant to cover the administrative costs associated with managing and processing the credit.</li> <li>Examples: These fees can include processing fees, commitment fees, documentation fees, and may vary according to the complexity of the export transaction and the services offered by the financing institution.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Understanding these terms not only helps exporters in managing their financial liabilities but also in negotiating better terms with financing institutions.

It can lead to customers being willing to pay more for a product with strong brand equity than for a similar, unbranded product.</p> <p>Brand Extension: When a company uses an existing, well-known brand name to launch a new product in a different category. For example, Apple using its brand to launch the Apple Watch, extending from electronics into wearable technology.</p> <p>Co-Branding: Two or more brands collaborate on a product or service, leveraging each other's reputation. An example is the partnership between Nike and Apple to create the Nike+ running shoes that sync with the Apple iPhone.

This approach allows teams to test ideas quickly and learn from each iteration, which can lead to better solutions and less risk of big failures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Problem-Focused Work: Lean UX teams are typically organized around specific user problems or business needs rather than just features or functions. This ensures that the work is highly relevant and that solutions are directly tied to addressing real challenges that users face.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empowering Teams: In Lean UX, teams are given the autonomy to make decisions quickly without waiting for approval from higher-ups. This empowerment speeds up the design process and helps build a sense of ownership and accountability among team members.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexible Toolset: Lean UX does not prescribe a rigid set of tools or processes; instead, it allows teams to adapt their methods and tools based on what works best for their specific project context. This flexibility helps teams stay agile and responsive to changing needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prototyping to Learn: Prototyping is a key strategy in Lean UX. It's used not only to test ideas but also as a tool for learning about user behavior and preferences. Quick, iterative prototypes help validate ideas early and frequently, reducing the risks and costs associated with fully developing untested features.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These principles form the foundation of Lean UX, guiding teams to focus on learning quickly and integrating user feedback at every step of the design and development process.

Investment refers to the process of using money to purchase assets with the expectation of generating returns in the future. Purpose Savings are typically made to fulfill short-term goals or for immediate needs, like emergencies or upcoming expenses. Investments are made with the intention of achieving long-term financial goals like retirement, wealth creation, or capital appreciation. Risk Savings generally carry low or negligible risk, as your funds are usually held in insured accounts like savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs). Investments involve varying degrees of risk, depending on the chosen asset class. Stocks and real estate may offer higher potential returns but carry higher risk, while bonds tend to offer lower risk but also lower returns. Returns Savings accounts typically offer low or no interest, meaning your money doesn't grow significantly over time. Investments have the potential to generate higher returns compared to savings. However, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and there's always a chance of losing money. Liquidity Savings are highly liquid, meaning you can easily access your money when needed. Investments can be less liquid, depending on the asset type. Stocks and bonds typically have high liquidity, while real estate or venture capital investments may be less accessible in the short term."},{"location":"4th_sem/docs/SAPM/Unit-1%20Introduction%20to%20Investment%20and%20Investment%20Avenues/1.b%20Comparison%20between%20Savings%2C%20Investment%2C%20Speculation%20and%20Gambling.html#speculation","title":"Speculation","text":"<p>Definition: The act of trading in an asset, or conducting a financial transaction, that has a significant risk of losing most or all of the initial outlay, in expectation of a substantial gain.</p> <ul> <li>Planning Horizon: Speculators have a very short planning horizon, usually extending from a few days to a few months.</li> <li>Risk: Speculators are ready to take very high levels of risk, often willing to lose their basic capital.</li> <li>Return Expectation: Speculators usually have very high return expectations and are prepared to bear high risks for potential gains.</li> <li>Basis of Decisions: Speculation gives more importance to technical charts, news, and market sentiments.</li> <li>Leverage: Speculators may invest borrowed funds and create leverage positions to maximize potential returns.</li> </ul> Points of Comparison Investor Speculator Planning Horizon Usually investors have longer investment horizon which leads to few years.

It is a measure of the intensity of competition in a particular market or industry. The level of competition can vary depending on the market structure and the number of competitors.</p> <p>There are four main levels of competition:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Pure Competition: This is characterized by many sellers producing similar products or services to many customers. The price is determined by the forces of supply and demand rather than decided by the seller. Examples include agricultural products such as wheat and corn.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monopolistic Competition: This is characterized by many manufacturers producing different products that can be substituted for each other. Companies in this environment often use aggressive advertising to attempt to influence the price of their products. Examples include Coke and Pepsi, which offer different products but compete in the same market.</p> </li> <li> <p>Oligopoly: This is characterized by few sellers, with each seller supplying a significant margin of all the products sold. The number of entrants in this market is minimal because of the high initial investment cost. Examples include airlines such as United Airlines and Continental.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monopoly: This is characterized by one company producing a unique product or service with no close substitutes. The company in this environment has complete market power and can influence the price of its product. Examples include public utilities such as gas, electric, and water.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The level of competition can have a significant impact on a business's operations, strategies, and performance. High levels of competition can result in fewer sales, reduced profits, and a smaller market share. On the other hand, low levels of competition can lead to higher profits and a larger market share. Understanding the level of competition in a business environment is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies to improve their competitive advantage.</p>"},{"location":"Aims_BBA/docs/BE/Module_01_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT/1.g_Competitive_Analysis_Frameworks.html","title":"1.g Competitive Analysis Frameworks","text":""},{"location":"Aims_BBA/docs/BE/Module_01_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT/1.g_Competitive_Analysis_Frameworks.html#brief-discussion-of-five-competitive-analysis-frameworks","title":"Brief Discussion of Five Competitive Analysis Frameworks","text":"<p>Competitive analysis frameworks are essential tools for businesses to understand their competitive landscape and develop effective strategies to stay ahead of the competition.
